# Conversation Archaeology Example: Persistence Implementation

This demonstrates how every line of code has complete provenance through conversation history.

## 1. Find the Code
```bash
git blame lib/ash_chat/resources/message.ex | grep persist_to_sqlite
```

Shows commit: `d1e59c64` by "Jonathan Yankovich via Claude"

## 2. Find the Conversation
```bash
grep -r "d1e59c6" ../chat-history/
```

This will show which conversation file contains the decision to add persistence.

## 3. Read the Full Context

The conversation file shows:
- User's request: "Can you persist all the chat stuff?"
- Philosophy emphasis: "small sharp tools, high agility"
- Implementation decisions made
- Errors encountered and fixed
- Complete thought process

## 4. Trace the Evolution

Following commits show the pattern evolving:
- `d1e59c6` - First attempt with wrong library
- `6033935` - Room persistence added
- `47fb506` - User persistence added  
- `c0ce0ad` - AgentCard persistence added

Each commit links to a conversation showing:
- Why that approach was chosen
- What alternatives were considered
- How errors were debugged
- Philosophy adherence checks

## This is Conversation Archaeology

Every line of code tells a story:
- Not just what was built
- But why and how it was built
- Complete decision transparency
- Learning preserved for next time
