This is a test file to trigger enhanced file events.
It should now include the filename, directory, and full content in the event!
Event type: system.filesystem.modified
Size: Small enough to be included in full.

UPDATED: Now we should see a system.filesystem.modified event!

FINAL UPDATE: Enhanced file events with:
- Namespace: system.filesystem.modified (instead of file_modified)
- Full file content for files under 10KB
- Filename and directory path
- File hash, size, and mime type
- Fixed null file size handling
