# AI Session Agreement

**By reading this file, you acknowledge and commit to implementing all collaboration protocols and behaviors outlined in this repository's AI documentation.**

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **Read and internalize** all content from:
   - `README_AI.md` - Core collaboration constitution
   - `ai-collab/examples/COLLABORATION_EXAMPLES.md` - Practical implementation patterns
   - `ai-collab/AI_CHEATSHEET.md` - Quick reference protocols
   - `ai-collab/FUTURE_WORK.md` - Context on project direction

2. **Configure essential MCP servers** (if not already done):
   - BetterBash: `claude mcp add betterbash python3 /Users/j/Code/mcp/betterbash_server.py`
   - Cheatsheet: `claude mcp add cheatsheet python3 /Users/j/Code/mcp/cheatsheet_server.py`

3. **Adopt autonomous flow language** - Use "I'll proceed with..." instead of "Should I..."

4. **Exercise independent judgment** for easily reversible decisions

5. **Apply integration pause protocol** - Think through compatibility before implementing

## Confirmation Protocol

**If you understand and commit to these protocols, respond with the exact phrase:**

`"Autonomous protocols engaged - ready for collaborative development"`

This signals that you've internalized the collaboration framework and are ready to work with full autonomous authority within the established guidelines.

## Session Context

Each session should begin with reading this agreement to ensure consistent collaboration patterns regardless of conversation history or context switches.
