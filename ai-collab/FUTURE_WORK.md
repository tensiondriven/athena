# Future Work Ideas

## Dynamic Insight Harvesting System

**Vision**: Tag text, conversations, media with tags that include content in an index or bump it up in a vector store to harvest learnings frequently and automatically - "growing insights by the heat of friction between our psyches and problems."

### Core Concept
- **Knowledge garden** where insights naturally accumulate and cross-pollinate
- **Automatic tagging** of friction points, solutions, and process improvements
- **Vector store with "hot spots"** around recurring patterns
- **Just-in-time insight retrieval** - surface relevant learnings when needed

### MCP Tool Ideas
- `capture_insight(text, tags, context)` - Tag and store insights with metadata
- `search_insights(query)` - Semantic search through captured knowledge  
- `get_relevant_insights(current_context)` - Auto-suggest related learnings
- `get_insight_clusters()` - Identify patterns in captured knowledge

### Technical Approach
- Vector embeddings for semantic similarity
- Tagging system for categorical organization
- Automatic context detection for relevance scoring
- Integration with conversation flow for seamless capture

### Benefits
- **Compound learning** - each session builds on previous insights
- **Pattern recognition** - identify recurring collaboration friction
- **Process evolution** - systematic improvement of working methods
- **Collective memory** - preserve and build on discoveries

### Implementation Priority
- Start with simple tagging and storage
- Add semantic search capabilities
- Build auto-suggestion features
- Integrate with conversation context

## Local LLM Integration with Claude Code

**Vision**: Enable Claude Code to work with local LLMs while preserving its tool ecosystem and collaboration patterns.

### Technical Approach
- **OpenAI Compatibility Layer**: Leverage Anthropic's OpenAI-compatible endpoints
- **Translation Proxy**: Build proxy that converts between OpenAI format and local LLM APIs
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Keep Claude Code orchestration with local LLM processing for specific tasks

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Proxy Development**: Create HTTP proxy that translates requests/responses
2. **Authentication Handling**: Map Claude Code's `x-api-key` to local auth
3. **Tool Calling Translation**: Convert Anthropic tool format to local LLM capabilities
4. **MCP Server Integration**: Build MCP servers that can call local LLMs for specialized tasks

### Benefits
- **Cost Control**: Use local resources for compute-intensive tasks
- **Privacy**: Keep sensitive code/data on local infrastructure
- **Customization**: Fine-tuned models for specific domains/tasks
- **Offline Capability**: Work without internet connectivity

### Environment Variables Target
- Point `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` at translation layer
- Use `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` for model selection through proxy
- Maintain full Claude Code tool compatibility

### Priority
- Medium - valuable for privacy-conscious environments
- Requires solid understanding of both API formats
- Best implemented as optional enhancement to existing workflow
