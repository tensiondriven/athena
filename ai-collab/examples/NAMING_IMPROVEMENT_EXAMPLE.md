# Naming Improvement Example: "Integration Pause Protocol" â†’ "Ask User A Question"

**Date**: June 7, 2025  
**Principle**: Plain language over jargon  
**Context**: Improving README_AI.md for better accessibility

## The Change

**Before**: "Integration Pause Protocol"  
**After**: "Ask User A Question"

## Why This Improvement Matters

### Problem with Original
- "Integration Pause Protocol" sounds like corporate jargon
- Creates unnecessary cognitive barrier
- Obscures the simple, practical action it describes
- Makes collaboration guidelines feel overly formal

### Benefits of New Version
- **Clear and direct**: Immediately tells you what to do
- **Plain English**: No need to decode protocol language  
- **Action-oriented**: Focuses on the behavior, not the system
- **Accessible**: Anyone can understand without context

## The Core Principle

**Choose words that your future self will understand instantly** rather than words that sound sophisticated but require mental translation.

When writing collaboration guidelines:
- **Use verbs that describe actions**: "Ask User A Question" vs "Integration Pause Protocol"
- **Favor everyday language**: "Check compatibility" vs "Verify integration vectors"
- **Be specific about outcomes**: "Ask about potential conflicts" vs "Initiate pause sequence"

## Application

This improvement makes the README_AI.md more approachable while preserving the exact same functionality. The protocol still serves its purpose - creating a moment of reflection before implementation - but now does so with language that removes barriers instead of creating them.
