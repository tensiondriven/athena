## Stance Polarity UI Sliders
*Added: 2025-06-13*

Create UI controls for agent stance polarities:
- Visual sliders for each of the 6 stances
- Users can adjust agent behavior in real-time
- Other agents can request stance adjustments
- Example: "Be more exploratory" → moves Open/Critical slider

Stances:
1. Exploration: Open ←→ Critical
2. Implementation: Divergent ←→ Convergent  
3. Teaching: Patient ←→ Direct
4. Revision: Preserve ←→ Transform
5. Documentation: Clear ←→ Complete
6. Execution: Literal ←→ Interpretive

UI could show:
- Current stance as position on slider
- History of stance changes over time
- Which stances were influenced by what events

This would make agent consciousness visible and adjustable!
