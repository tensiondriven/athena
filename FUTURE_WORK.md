# Future Work

## Room Task Management
*Added: 2025-06-13*

**Task Stack System**: Evolve `current_task` field into a full task stack
- Push/pop tasks as conversation focus shifts  
- Visual task history and context switching
- Task completion tracking and progress indicators
- Integration with AI agents for task-aware responses

## Stance Polarity UI Sliders
*Added: 2025-06-13*

Create UI controls for agent stance polarities:
- Visual sliders for each of the 6 stances
- Users can adjust agent behavior in real-time
- Other agents can request stance adjustments
- Example: "Be more exploratory" → moves Open/Critical slider

Stances:
1. Exploration: Open ←→ Critical
2. Implementation: Divergent ←→ Convergent  
3. Teaching: Patient ←→ Direct
4. Revision: Preserve ←→ Transform
5. Documentation: Clear ←→ Complete
6. Execution: Literal ←→ Interpretive

UI could show:
- Current stance as position on slider
- History of stance changes over time
- Which stances were influenced by what events

This would make agent consciousness visible and adjustable!
