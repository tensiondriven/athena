# Neo4j MCP Clients & Servers

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a [standardized protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) for managing context between large language models (LLMs) and external systems. 

This lets you use Claude Desktop, or any other MCP Client (VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf), to use natural language to accomplish things with Neo4j and your Aura account, e.g.:

* What is in this graph?
* Render a chart from the top products sold by frequency, total and average volume
* List my instances
* Create a new instance named mcp-test for Aura Professional with 4GB and Graph Data Science enabled
* Store the fact that I worked on the Neo4j MCP Servers today with Andreas and Oskar
