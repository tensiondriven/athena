# üîç‚ÅâÔ∏è Neo4j MCP Server

## üåü Overview

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation that provides database interaction and allows graph exploration capabilities through Neo4j. This server enables running Cypher graph queries, analyzing complex domain data, and automatically generating business insights that can be enhanced with Claude's analysis.

## üß© Components

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools

The server offers these core tools:

#### üìä Query Tools
- `read-neo4j-cypher`
   - Execute Cypher read queries to read data from the database
   - Input: 
     - `query` (string): The Cypher query to execute
     - `params` (dictionary, optional): Parameters to pass to the Cypher query
   - Returns: Query results as JSON serialized array of objects

- `write-neo4j-cypher`
   - Execute updating Cypher queries
   - Input:
     - `query` (string): The Cypher update query
     - `params` (dictionary, optional): Parameters to pass to the Cypher query
   - Returns: A JSON serialized result summary counter with `{ nodes_updated: number, relationships_created: number, ... }`

#### üï∏Ô∏è Schema Tools
- `get-neo4j-schema`
   - Get a list of all nodes types in the graph database, their attributes with name, type and relationships to other node types
   - No input required
   - Returns: JSON serialized list of node labels with two dictionaries: one for attributes and one for relationships

## üîß Usage with Claude Desktop

### üíæ Released Package

Can be found on PyPi https://pypi.org/project/mcp-neo4j-cypher/

Add the server to your `claude_desktop_config.json` with the database connection configuration through environment variables. You may also specify the transport method with cli arguments.

```json
"mcpServers": {
  "neo4j-aura": {
    "command": "uvx",
    "args": [ "mcp-neo4j-cypher@0.2.2", "--transport", "stdio"  ],
    "env": {
      "NEO4J_URI": "bolt://localhost:7687",
      "NEO4J_USERNAME": "neo4j",
      "NEO4J_PASSWORD": "<your-password>",
      "NEO4J_DATABASE": "neo4j"
    }
  }
}
```

Here is an example connection for the movie database with Movie, Person (Actor, Director), Genre, User and ratings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "movies-neo4j": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [ "mcp-neo4j-cypher@0.2.2" ],
      "env": {
        "NEO4J_URI": "neo4j+s://demo.neo4jlabs.com",
        "NEO4J_USERNAME": "recommendations",
        "NEO4J_PASSWORD": "recommendations",
        "NEO4J_DATABASE": "recommendations"
      }
    }   
  }
}
```

Syntax with `--db-url`, `--username` and `--password` command line arguments is still supported but environment variables are preferred:

  "neo4j": {
    "command": "uvx",
    "args": [
      "mcp-neo4j-cypher@0.2.2",
      "--db-url",
      "bolt://localhost",
      "--username",
      "neo4j",
      "--password",
      "<your-password>"
    ]
  }
}
```

Here is an example connection for the movie database with Movie, Person (Actor, Director), Genre, User and ratings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "movies-neo4j": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-neo4j-cypher@0.2.2", 
      "--db-url", "neo4j+s://demo.neo4jlabs.com", 
      "--user", "recommendations", 
      "--password", "recommendations",
      "--database", "recommendations"]
    }   
  }
}
```
