# Webcam-PTZ Implementation Status

**For the next person working on this project:**

## ‚úÖ **UPDATED**: Now Native Implementation
The webcam-ptz functionality has been **converted from git submodule to native code** in `webcam-ptz-native/` directory.

## What It Does
- Command-line tool to pan, tilt, and zoom UVC-compatible USB webcams
- Tested with Logitech Brio and Webcam Pro 9000
- Integrates with Athena's hardware control layer for camera automation

## Current Location
**NEW**: `system/hardware-controls/webcam-ptz-native/`
- ‚úÖ All essential files copied (source, executable, docs)
- ‚úÖ No more git submodule complexity
- ‚úÖ Clean git status - no more "dirty" submodule

## Integration Context
This tool is part of Athena's distributed camera system:
- **Purpose**: Low-level hardware control for PTZ cameras
- **Architecture**: Called by PTZ REST API (`../ptz-rest-api/`) 
- **MCP Integration**: Controlled via `system/athena-mcp/ptz_mcp_server.py`
- **Dependencies**: libuvc and libusb (executable included, no compilation needed)

## Known Working State
- ‚úÖ Camera responds to `./webcam-ptz pan middle` commands
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May get blocked by `cameracaptured` process after ~30 seconds
- üîß **Fix**: `sudo pkill cameracaptured` to release camera control

## Migration Notes
- **Removed**: External git submodule (ancient, no updates expected)
- **Kept**: Essential files only (~40KB vs 75KB+ with git metadata)
- **Preserved**: All custom documentation and MCP configuration
- **Benefit**: Simplified maintenance, no submodule issues

## Next Steps for Developers
1. Test camera connectivity: `cd webcam-ptz-native && ./webcam-ptz pan middle`
2. Review CLAUDE.md for detailed integration history
3. Check PTZ REST API integration status
4. Verify MCP server communication pathway
