# Testing Philosophy for Athena Distributed System

## Core Principle: Fail Fast and Loud

The system has many moving parts - collectors, APIs, databases, file systems, Docker containers, network connections. Each component can break in obvious ways (missing files) or subtle ways (wrong permissions, bad configs). Our testing strategy prioritizes early detection over comprehensive coverage.

## Three-Layer Testing Strategy

### 1. Startup Validation (Required)
Every component must validate its world before starting:
- **Paths exist and are writable**: Don't assume, verify
- **Environment variables present and sane**: Check ranges, formats, required values
- **Database connections work**: Actually query, don't just connect
- **External dependencies respond**: APIs, file systems, hardware
- **Permissions allow expected operations**: Test write, read, execute as needed

**Non-negotiable rule**: If any dependency is broken, exit with clear error message and fix instructions.

### 2. Runtime Health Monitoring
Continuous verification that the system is actually functioning:
- **Deep health checks**: `/health` endpoints that exercise real functionality
- **Functional smoke tests**: Actually collect a file, take a screenshot, write to database
- **Performance monitoring**: Detect when things get slow or stuck
- **Resource checks**: Disk space, memory, connection pools

### 3. Integration Proof Points
End-to-end flows that prove the system works as intended:
- **File lifecycle**: Create → Detect → Store → Query → Retrieve
- **API workflows**: Request → Process → Respond → Verify
- **Event flows**: Generate → Collect → Process → Store
- **Cross-service communication**: Verify actual data exchange

## Testing Implementation

### Immediate Feedback
- `--verify` startup mode: Run all checks, report results, exit
- `--smoke-test` mode: Quick functional verification 
- Development dashboards showing real-time system health
- Error messages with specific fix instructions

### Continuous Monitoring
- Health endpoints that test real functionality
- Automatic degradation detection
- Performance baselines with alerts
- Resource usage monitoring

The goal: Anyone should be able to run one command and know if the system is working or exactly what's broken.
