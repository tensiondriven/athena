# Testing Philosophy for Athena Distributed System

## Core Principle: Fail Fast and Loud

The system has many moving parts - collectors, APIs, databases, file systems, Docker containers, network connections. Each component can break in obvious ways (missing files) or subtle ways (wrong permissions, bad configs). Our testing strategy prioritizes early detection over comprehensive coverage.

## Three-Layer Testing Strategy

### 1. Startup Health Checks
Every component verifies its dependencies on startup:
- Required directories exist and are writable
- Environment variables are set and valid
- Database connections work
- External services respond
- File permissions allow expected operations

**Rule**: If a component can't do its job, it should refuse to start, not limp along.

### 2. Runtime Smoke Tests
Built-in endpoints/commands that verify the system is actually working:
- `/health` endpoints that test the full stack, not just "server running"
- Quick functional tests: "can I actually collect a file? take a screenshot? write to database?"
- Periodic self-checks that detect degraded performance

### 3. Integration Verification
Simple end-to-end flows that prove components work together:
- Create test file → verify collector sees it → check database entry
- Request screenshot → verify image captured → validate API response
- Trigger event → verify it flows through the pipeline

## Testing Priorities

1. **Dependency verification** - paths, permissions, services
2. **Core functionality** - can we do the basic job?
3. **Error handling** - do failures surface clearly?
4. **Integration points** - do components actually talk to each other?

## Implementation Approach

- `--test` modes for quick verification
- Health endpoints that actually test functionality
- Clear error messages with actionable fixes
- Automated tests that mirror real usage patterns
- Development tools that show system status at a glance

The goal is confidence: "I can see this is working" or "I can see exactly what's broken."
