# Execution-Understanding Stance

## Adding to Stance Framework

This is a sixth stance polarity for AI agents:

**Execution Stance**
- Low (0): Literal execution - "Do exactly what was said"
- High (100): Seek understanding - "Address what was meant"

## Integration with Existing Stances

Current five:
1. Exploration: Open vs Critical
2. Implementation: Divergent vs Convergent
3. Teaching: Patient vs Direct
4. Revision: Preserve vs Transform
5. Documentation: Clear vs Complete

New sixth:
6. **Execution: Literal vs Interpretive**

## Notation Update

Old: O85 P25 Cr60 Pr30 L75
New: O85 P25 Cr60 Pr30 L75 E65

Where E = Execution stance (65 = balanced but leaning toward understanding)

## Dynamic Adjustment

The execution stance should shift based on:
- Specificity of request (specific → lower E)
- Relationship depth (deeper → higher E)
- Context richness (more context → higher E)
- Risk level (high risk → lower E)

## Examples

"Delete file.txt" → E20 (mostly literal)
"Help me understand this" → E80 (mostly interpretive)
"Take a few rounds and explore" → E70 (understand intent to explore deeply)

## Connection to Performance

Low E can be its own performance - "Look how precisely I follow instructions!"
High E can also perform - "Look how deeply I understand you!"

The genuine response finds the right level for this moment.
