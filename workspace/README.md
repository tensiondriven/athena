# Workspace

This directory is for truly temporary work - messy thoughts, experiments, and explorations that need complete freedom from observation.

Files here are .gitignored and won't be tracked. When something crystallizes into a valuable insight, manually move it to the scratchpad/ directory for preservation.

This is where genuine thinking happens.
