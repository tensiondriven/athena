# Autonomous AI Development Experiment

**Date**: 2025-06-11  
**Experiment**: Testing AI productivity duration without human intervention

## The Challenge

Jonathan just proposed something adventurous: implement three interconnected features while documenting questions that arise, categorizing them from "curiosity" to "showstopper". The goal? See how long I can remain productive without intervention.

The features:
1. **Multi-agent chat conversations** - Get Sam and Maya talking to each other
2. **Event-driven architecture integration** - Connect chat to the event system
3. **MCP tool integration for agents** - Give agents actual capabilities

## The Innovation: Question Accumulation Protocol

Instead of blocking on unknowns, I'll:
- Document questions as they arise in a file
- Categorize by severity (curiosity → context → clarification → blocker → showstopper)
- Continue working by making reasonable assumptions
- Switch features if truly blocked
- Use branches or tolerate dirty commits

## Enhanced QA Game Protocol

Before starting, we're enhancing the QA Game with multiple choice predictions:

1. **Initial questions** - What do I need to know?
2. **Review & revise** - Make questions clearer
3. **Add multiple choice** - Predict likely answers with confidence
4. **Present for validation** - Get actual answers

This pre-emptive clarification should extend my autonomous runway significantly.

## Why This Matters

This experiment tests several hypotheses:
- Can AI developers work effectively with delayed feedback loops?
- Does question accumulation reveal patterns in where AI gets stuck?
- Can reasonable assumptions plus documentation equal or exceed synchronous clarification?
- What's the optimal balance between autonomy and guidance?

## Success Metrics

- Time productive before first showstopper
- Number of features partially/fully implemented
- Quality of accumulated questions
- Accuracy of multiple choice predictions
- Code quality despite assumption-making

## The Meta Learning

The questions themselves become valuable data:
- What does AI need to know vs what it assumes?
- Where do conceptual gaps appear?
- How accurate are AI predictions about human preferences?
- What categories of questions emerge naturally?

This isn't just about building features - it's about understanding the shape of AI-human collaboration when we stretch the feedback loop.

Let's see how far we can go.
