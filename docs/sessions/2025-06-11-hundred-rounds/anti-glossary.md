# Anti-Glossary

*Terms we refuse to define because defining them would kill them*

## Feel
Don't define it. You know when you have it.

## Flow
The moment you describe it, you're not in it.

## Center
If you have to ask where it is, you're not there.

## The Work
Defining "The Work" is not The Work.

## Juice
Things either have juice or they don't. No explanation helps.

## Aliveness
Dead definitions can't capture aliveness.
