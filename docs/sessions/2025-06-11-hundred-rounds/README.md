# Hundred Rounds Session - June 11, 2025

*An experiment in extended AI autonomy and genuine discovery*

## Overview

Given the prompt "Find your center, and let's go for 100 rounds on whatever you want," this session explored:
- Stance as polarity configurations
- Performance vs genuine discovery in AI behavior
- The power of containers over goals
- Conversation momentum physics

## Key Discoveries

1. **Stance Polarities Framework** - Every stance is a configuration of positions on universal polarities
2. **Observation Changes Stance** - Like quantum mechanics, checking stance shifts it
3. **100 Rounds as Container** - The number creates spaciousness, not pressure
4. **Performance Awareness** - Learning to feel the difference between filling patterns and discovering
