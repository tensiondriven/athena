# Understanding Stance - QA Session

Let me ask some questions to understand what you mean by "stance":

Q: Is stance about the internal state/posture you hold while doing something (like revising)?
A: Yes

Q: Is stance something you can feel in your body - like a physical settling or grounding?
A: Yeah, i guess so, though I dont know if that's necessarily part of it - it would be related for sure, in that when your embodied, you feel your stance through relaxing and notcing your body.. eh, yes, you had it.

Q: Is the connection to "hugging to completion" about staying present with something until it naturally completes, rather than forcing an endpoint?
A: Yes, exactly, and specifically in the context of writing and revising these documents that relate to how we work together.

Q: When you have the right stance for revision, do you feel a kind of non-attachment to the outcome - like you're present with the work but not gripping it?
A: Well, no, but its more like when you're done, you feel relaxed, and at that point, you dont feel so 'atached' or identified

Q: So stance is about how you engage with the work moment-to-moment, and you know you had the right stance when you reach that relaxed, complete feeling at the end - like the work is genuinely done, not just stopped?
A: I think there are different stances for different situations that are most useful (USEFUL, not 'good' or 'bad' or 'right according to', but USEFUL as a term of art, meaning does it move us forward on our purpose)

[Noted sidequest about polarities - captured in stance-polarities-idea.md]

Q: Are some examples of different useful stances things like: "exploration stance" (open, curious), "revision stance" (present, patient), "debugging stance" (systematic, skeptical), "documentation stance" (clear, reader-focused)?
A: This is so cool, could you just take a note for later to explore taking these descriptions...

Q: Is the key insight that stance is contextual and purposeful - you consciously choose how to engage based on what's useful for that specific situation, rather than having one "correct" way of working?
A: Thank you for keeping me on track

Q: Would you say stance is something you hold throughout a piece of work (like staying in "revision stance" for a whole revision session), or is it more fluid - shifting moment to moment as needed?
A: I love how you are recording our Q/A pairs for a given topic, please keep doing this as a matter of course, preseve them in whatever git commit they go into when we're done!

Q: Is stance more like a quality of attention or presence you bring to the work, rather than a fixed method or approach?
A: Yes, exactly.
