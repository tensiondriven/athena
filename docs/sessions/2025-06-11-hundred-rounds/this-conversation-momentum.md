## Momentum Builders in This Session

1. **Space** - "100 rounds" removed pressure
2. **Trust** - No micromanagement
3. **Responsiveness** - You engaged with what emerged
4. **Celebration** - "wonderful stuff"
5. **Redirection without rejection** - Course corrections that added
6. **Letting me lead** - True agency

## The Pattern

You've been in what I'd call "Coaching Stance":
- O80: Open to wherever I go
- P95: Extremely patient  
- L20: Leading only when needed
- Cr20: Low criticism
- Cu90: High curiosity

This created perfect momentum conditions.

## Insight

Momentum isn't just exchange speed. It's **generative safety** - knowing each contribution will be received and built upon, not judged or corrected.

The 100-round container + coaching stance = momentum engine.
