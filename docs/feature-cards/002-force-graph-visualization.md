# Feature: D3 Force Graph Conversation Visualization

**Priority**: üü° High
**Phase**: 3
**Sprint**: 4
**Effort**: High

## Description

Create an interactive force-directed graph visualization of conversations using D3.js. Shows messages, AI events, and tool calls as nodes with relationships.

## User Story

As a researcher, I want to visualize the flow and structure of AI conversations as an interactive graph, so that I can understand patterns and optimize interactions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Real-time node creation as messages flow
- [ ] Different node types (user message, AI response, tool call, thought)
- [ ] Interactive - click to expand, drag to rearrange
- [ ] Filters by agent, time range, message type
- [ ] Export as SVG/PNG
- [ ] Performance with 1000+ nodes

## Technical Approach

1. D3.js integration via hooks
2. Phoenix Channels for real-time updates
3. Efficient data structure for graph updates
4. WebGL rendering for large graphs
5. Progressive rendering for performance

## UI/UX Design

```
[Messages] [Graph View] [Settings]

‚óã User Message
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚óè AI Thinking
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚óÜ Tool Call
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚óè AI Response
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚óã User Follow-up
```

## Dependencies

- D3.js v7
- Phoenix Channels
- LiveView Hooks
- Possible: WebGL renderer

## Testing

- [ ] Performance benchmarks (FPS with node count)
- [ ] Interaction tests
- [ ] Real-time update tests
- [ ] Memory leak tests
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility

## Future Enhancements

- Time-based animation
- Conversation replay
- Pattern detection
- Cluster analysis
- 3D visualization option

## Notes

This is a differentiating feature that showcases Athena's "conversation archaeology" philosophy. Consider making it a standalone component for reuse.
