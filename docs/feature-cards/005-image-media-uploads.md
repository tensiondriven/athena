# Feature: Image and Media Upload System

**Priority**: 🟡 High
**Phase**: 2
**Sprint**: 2
**Effort**: Medium

## Description

Enable users to upload images and other media files in chat, with inline preview, storage, and AI vision capabilities.

## User Story

As a user, I want to share images and files in chat so that I can have richer conversations with visual context and document sharing.

## Features

### Image Handling
- Drag & drop upload
- Paste from clipboard
- Multiple image selection
- Automatic resizing/optimization
- Inline preview with lightbox
- AI vision analysis integration

### File Handling
- Document uploads (PDF, DOC, etc.)
- Code files with syntax highlighting
- Audio/video with player controls
- File size limits and validation
- Virus scanning
- Metadata extraction

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Drag & drop works on all platforms
- [ ] Images display inline immediately
- [ ] Files show appropriate previews
- [ ] Progress indication for uploads
- [ ] Error handling for failed uploads
- [ ] Storage optimization (compression, CDN)
- [ ] AI can analyze uploaded images

## Technical Approach

1. **Frontend**
   - LiveView upload component
   - Drag & drop hooks
   - Preview generation
   - Progress tracking

2. **Backend**
   - Phoenix upload pipeline
   - Image processing (libvips/ImageMagick)
   - S3-compatible storage
   - CDN integration

3. **AI Integration**
   - Vision model support
   - Automatic image descriptions
   - OCR for text extraction

## UI/UX Design

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📎 Drop files here or click     │
│                                 │
│ [=====>    ] 45% photo.jpg     │
└─────────────────────────────────┘

## Storage Strategy

- Local development: File system
- Production: S3 with CloudFront
- Thumbnails: Generated on upload
- Retention: Configurable per room

## Dependencies

- Phoenix.LiveView.Upload
- Image processing library
- S3 adapter
- CDN service
- Vision AI API

## Security Considerations

- File type validation
- Size limits (10MB images, 50MB files)
- Virus scanning for executables
- EXIF data stripping
- Rate limiting

## Testing

- [ ] Upload progress and cancellation
- [ ] Multiple file handling
- [ ] Error scenarios
- [ ] Performance with large files
- [ ] Mobile upload experience

## Future Enhancements

- Video transcoding
- Audio transcription
- Document parsing (PDF → text)
- Image editing tools
- Gallery view for room media

## Notes

This significantly enhances conversation richness. Ensure accessibility with alt text and descriptions. Consider progressive loading for performance.
