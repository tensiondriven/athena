# Feature: Interruptible AI Generation

**Priority**: ðŸ”´ Critical
**Phase**: 2
**Sprint**: 1
**Effort**: Medium

## Description

Allow users to send new messages while AI agents are still generating responses. Currently, the UI blocks input during generation, leading to frustrating user experience.

## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to type and send new messages even while the AI is still thinking/typing, so that I can maintain my flow of thought without waiting.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Input field remains active during AI generation
- [ ] New user messages cancel ongoing AI generation
- [ ] Cancelled generations are marked appropriately in the UI
- [ ] System handles race conditions gracefully
- [ ] Works across all agent types and providers

## Technical Approach

1. Decouple UI state from generation state
2. Implement generation cancellation in GenServer
3. Add PubSub message for cancellation events
4. Update LiveView to handle concurrent states

## Dependencies

- Phoenix PubSub
- Agent GenServer architecture
- LiveView state management

## Testing

- [ ] Unit tests for cancellation logic
- [ ] Integration tests for race conditions
- [ ] UI tests for user experience
- [ ] Load tests with multiple concurrent users

## Notes

This is a critical UX improvement that affects all chat interactions. Should be implemented early in Phase 2.
