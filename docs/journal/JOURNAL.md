# Athena Project Journal

## 2025-06-07 - Project Structure Analysis & PTZ Connector Organization

### Actions Taken
- Created `connectors/` directory structure for organizing multiple connector services
- Moved `athena-ptz-connector` into `connectors/athena-ptz-connector/`
- Analyzed overall project state and implementation status

### Current Project Status Analysis

#### What's Currently Working/Complete ‚úÖ

**BigPlan/Surveillance System (Most Complete)**
- **Status**: Implementation complete and validated üöÄ
- **Components**: Full end-to-end surveillance pipeline with SAM ‚Üí CLIP ‚Üí Rules ‚Üí Dashboard
- **Infrastructure**: Docker orchestration with Redis, Qdrant vector DB, CLIP encoder, rules engine, and web dashboard
- **Testing**: Comprehensive integration tests and proof-of-concept validation
- **Location**: `/Users/j/Code/athena/bigplan/`

**Athena-Capture (Core Framework Implemented)**
- **Status**: Core event detection infrastructure implemented
- **Features**: Screenshot capture, PTZ camera control, conversation monitoring, event storage
- **Integration**: Working PTZ camera positioning with imagesnap, SQLite event storage
- **API**: Well-defined interfaces for event streaming
- **Location**: `/Users/j/Code/athena/athena-capture/`

**Athena-SAM (Functional Pipeline)**
- **Status**: Working webcam image processing pipeline
- **Features**: YAML configuration, real-time processing, SAM integration at llm:8100
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test script for SAM server validation
- **Location**: `/Users/j/Code/athena/athena-sam/`

#### What's Partially Implemented üöß

**Athena-Ingest (Architecture Defined, Implementation Pending)**
- **Status**: Well-documented architecture but mostly unimplemented
- **Planned**: LlamaIndex multimodal RAG pipeline, Neo4j knowledge graph construction
- **Dependencies**: Requires athena-capture event feed integration
- **Location**: `/Users/j/Code/athena/athena-ingest/`

**Camera Collector (Advanced Architecture, Incomplete)**
- **Status**: Sophisticated Elixir application structure with Neo4j integration
- **Features**: Event processing pipeline, inference engine, webhook router
- **Gap**: Missing actual camera feed integration and processing logic
- **Location**: `/Users/j/Code/athena/athena-ingest/camera_collector/`

#### What's Missing or Needs Work Next ‚ùå

**PTZ Connector (Skeleton Only)**
- **Status**: Only mix.exs file exists with MQTT dependencies defined
- **Gap**: No actual implementation - missing all modules, supervision tree, and business logic
- **Expected**: Should mirror athena-capture's PTZ functionality but as standalone service
- **Location**: `/Users/j/Code/athena/connectors/athena-ptz-connector/`

**Athena-NER (Basic Script)**
- **Status**: Simple named entity recognition script, not integrated
- **Gap**: No connection to broader pipeline or knowledge graph
- **Location**: `/Users/j/Code/athena/athena-ner/`

**Project Integration**
- **Gap**: Components exist in isolation without inter-service communication
- **Missing**: Event bus/messaging system to connect capture ‚Üí ingest ‚Üí knowledge graph

### Suggested Next Steps

#### Immediate Priority (1-2 weeks)

1. **Complete PTZ Connector Implementation**
   - Implement the missing Elixir modules based on athena-capture's PTZ functionality
   - Add MQTT communication layer for remote PTZ control
   - Create supervision tree and application structure

2. **Integrate BigPlan with Live Cameras**
   - Connect the working surveillance system to actual camera feeds
   - Replace static test images with real-time camera streams
   - Deploy and validate the complete surveillance pipeline

#### Medium Priority (2-4 weeks)

3. **Connect Athena-Capture to Athena-Ingest**
   - Implement the event streaming interface between capture and ingest
   - Start with file system events and screenshots
   - Build basic knowledge graph construction

4. **Deploy Camera Collector**
   - Complete the Elixir camera collector implementation
   - Integrate with Neo4j for knowledge storage
   - Connect to webhook-based camera feeds

#### Longer Term (1-2 months)

5. **Complete LlamaIndex Integration**
   - Implement the full multimodal RAG pipeline in athena-ingest
   - Add CLIP embeddings and semantic search
   - Build query interface for knowledge graph

6. **Unify Architecture**
   - Create consistent messaging/event bus across all components
   - Standardize configuration and deployment
   - Add monitoring and observability

### Key Insights
- **BigPlan is production-ready** and should be the foundation for immediate surveillance deployment
- **Athena-Capture has solid foundations** but needs integration work
- **PTZ Connector is the most critical gap** - it's referenced but completely unimplemented
- **The project shows excellent planning** with comprehensive documentation, but implementation is scattered
- **Neo4j integration appears in multiple places** but isn't fully realized anywhere

### Decisions Pending
- Whether to prioritize PTZ connector completion vs BigPlan production deployment vs system integration
- MQTT usage clarification for PTZ connector (appears to be for agent communication)
