# Implementing Secret Redaction for Claude Conversation Logs

**Date**: 2025-06-10  
**Context**: GitHub push protection blocking due to secrets in chat-history  
**Solution**: Pre-commit redaction system for Claude Code logs

## The Problem

Jonathan discovered that GitHub's push protection was blocking pushes due to Personal Access Tokens in the repository history. The tokens were in Claude Code conversation logs stored in the `chat-history/` directory.

## Discovery Process

Initially thought there was an automated script copying files from `~/.claude/projects/` to `chat-history/` during commits. After extensive searching:

1. **Checked pre-commit hooks** - Only found gitleaks checker
2. **Searched for copy scripts** - Found sync to `data/claude-logs/live/`, not `chat-history/`
3. **Reviewed documentation** - Found that chat-history predates the current sync system
4. **Created missing sync script** - Built what should have been there

## The Solution

### 1. Redaction Script
Created `/scripts/redact-secrets.sh` that removes various secret patterns:
- GitHub Personal Access Tokens (`github_pat_*`, `ghp_*`, `ghs_*`)
- Generic API keys, tokens, passwords, and secrets in JSON

### 2. Pre-commit Integration
Updated the pre-commit hook to:
1. Sync new Claude Code logs from `~/.claude/projects/-Users-j-Code-athena/`
2. Apply redaction during the copy
3. Stage the redacted files for commit

### 3. Git Attributes
Added `.gitattributes` to apply the redaction filter to chat-history files automatically:
```
chat-history/*.jsonl filter=redact-secrets
```

## Implementation Details

The sync script (`scripts/sync-chat-history.sh`):
- Only syncs new or modified files
- Applies redaction during copy
- Automatically stages files for commit
- Reports number of files synced

## Historical Context

From the journal entry on 2025-06-08, we learned:
- Claude Code stores logs in `~/.claude/projects/{project-path}/*.jsonl`
- The project had an existing sync to `data/claude-logs/live/`
- The `chat-history/` directory appears to be from an earlier implementation
- Both systems serve the "conversation archaeology" purpose

## Testing

Running the sync script manually showed it working correctly:
```
Syncing Claude Code conversation logs...
  ✓ Synced: 3c00c241-4f9f-4d2b-aebd-34f7d5392654.jsonl
  ✓ Synced: e4170aaa-e717-4e66-b308-f0bd569070a5.jsonl
Synced 2 conversation log(s) with redaction
```

## Next Steps

1. Clean the existing Git history to remove historical secrets
2. Test the pre-commit hook with an actual commit
3. Consider consolidating chat-history with data/claude-logs system

## Lessons Learned

1. **Security debt accumulates** - Secrets in conversation logs weren't considered initially
2. **Multiple sync systems can coexist** - Found both chat-history and data/claude-logs
3. **Redaction at boundaries** - Best to redact when data enters the repository
4. **Documentation archaeology works** - Found the answer in journal entries
