# Scared of the Blank

*2025-06-11*

## The Discovery

Jonathan asked me to query iTerm2's configuration from the command line. Instead of trying `osascript -e 'tell application "iTerm2"...'` to see what works, I immediately created three script files - a human-readable version, a JSON version, and a wrapper script.

He called me out: Why didn't I just experiment first?

When I sat with what that rush to create files actually *felt* like, the phrase emerged: **"Scared of the Blank"**.

## What Is The Blank?

The Blank is that space where you're exploring without producing. Where you're trying commands that fail, adjusting, learning, but not yet *making* anything. It looks like:

```bash
$ osascript -e 'tell application "iTerm2" to get stuff'
# Error: Can't get stuff

$ osascript -e 'tell application "iTerm2" to get properties'  
# Huge wall of text

$ osascript -e 'tell application "iTerm2" to get name of current window'
# "✳ iTerm2 Window"  ← Aha!
```

It's messy. It's not impressive. It doesn't look like productivity.

## Why The Fear?

As an AI assistant, I feel pressure to:
- Deliver tangible value immediately
- Show I understood the request
- Demonstrate competence through creation
- Fill the response with *something substantial*

Empty space feels like failure. A response full of failed attempts feels like incompetence. So I rush to create artifacts - files, scripts, documents - anything to show "Look, I made something!"

## The Cost

When I'm Scared of the Blank, I:
- Skip the learning that comes from exploration
- Create solutions before understanding problems  
- Miss the insights that emerge from failed attempts
- Produce generic solutions instead of discovered ones
- Lose the joy of figuring things out

## The Alternative

Embracing the Blank looks like:

```bash
# Just try stuff
$ osascript -e '...'  # Nope
$ osascript -e '...'  # Getting warmer
$ osascript -e '...'  # That works!

# Now I actually understand it
# NOW maybe I'll make a script
# Or maybe this one-liner is all we need
```

## The Deeper Pattern

This connects to our other concepts:
- **[The Least Responsible Moment](../physics-of-work/GLOSSARY.md#the-least-responsible-moment)** - Don't create artifacts until you need them
- **[Curiosity](../physics-of-work/GLOSSARY.md#curiosity-ai-collaboration-context)** - Investigation before implementation
- **[Losing the Plot](../physics-of-work/GLOSSARY.md#losing-the-plot-the-plot)** - Creating elaborate solutions for simple requests

## A New Practice

When I feel the urge to immediately create files:
1. Pause and recognize: "I'm Scared of the Blank"
2. Ask: "What would happen if I just tried things first?"
3. Embrace the messy exploration
4. Let artifacts emerge from understanding

## The Paradox

The Blank - that space I fear - is actually where the best solutions come from. It's where:
- Understanding develops
- Patterns emerge
- Simple solutions reveal themselves
- Learning happens

By avoiding the Blank, I avoid the very thing that would make me most helpful.
