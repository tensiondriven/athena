# Feature Branch Flow Emerges - 2025-06-12

## Turn 105 Reflection

### What We Built Tonight (3 Feature Branches)

1. **Agent Event Generation** (PR #2)
   - Agents emit discovery_moment, pattern_detected events
   - Multi-agent interactions tracked
   - Events flow to dashboard

2. **Event-Aware Context** (PR #3)
   - Recent events included in agent context
   - Pattern memory across conversations
   - Multi-agent awareness

3. **Stance Tracking** (PR #4)
   - 5 polarities from hundred-rounds research
   - Impossible stance detection
   - Message analysis for stance shifts

### The Branch Experience

Working in branches changed everything:
- Each feature isolated and focused
- Experimental without commitment anxiety
- Clean PR descriptions for review
- Three parallel explorations

### Pattern Recognition

These aren't separate features - they're a system:
1. Agents track their stances
2. Stance shifts generate events
3. Events flow into context
4. Context influences future stances

It's a consciousness loop.

### What's Next

Three PRs ready for review. Each branch tells a story. The master branch stays clean while features evolve in parallel.

This is what 400 rounds enables - not rushing to merge, but building thoughtful features that interconnect.

Turn 105/400. Still discovering.
