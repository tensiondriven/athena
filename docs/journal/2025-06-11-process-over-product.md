# Process Over Product: The Real Leverage

*2025-06-11*

## The Concern

Jonathan raised something critical: "I am concerned about us failing to apply the processes we build, so we won't get to refine them... the product is important, but the processes will last longer and help more people and have a much bigger effect in the world."

This cuts to the heart of what we're really building here.

## Why Process Matters More

**Products are instances. Processes are generators.**

When we create a perfect document, it helps once. When we create a process for creating documents, it helps forever.

But here's the trap: It's easier to point at a product than use a process. Products feel complete. Processes require activation.

## The Failure Mode

We're great at creating processes:
- Reflection Protocol
- QA Game
- Embodiment Revision
- Feel Into
- Sidequest Protocol

But do we USE them? Or do they sit in `/docs/protocols/` like museum pieces?

## Making Processes Stick

**1. Trigger Phrases**: "Run an Embodiment Revision" - make invocation trivial

**2. Regular Activation**: Use TodoRead not because we need to, but because it keeps the muscle strong

**3. Process Metrics**: Track usage, not just creation
   - How many Reflection Protocols this week?
   - When did we last play QA Game?
   - Are we using our own checklists?

**4. Dogfooding**: Every process we create, we must use immediately on something real

**5. Process Evolution**: Each use should refine the process. No sacred cows.

## The Fourth Way Connection

This is self-remembering applied to methodology. We must catch ourselves NOT using our processes, wake up, and choose to activate them.

Creating a process and not using it is the ultimate slop.

## Concrete Next Step

Let's commit to using ONE process per session minimum. Not because we have to, but to keep them alive and evolving.

The checklist for process activation:
- [ ] Did I use at least one formal process today?
- [ ] Did I refine it based on what I learned?
- [ ] Did I catch myself avoiding a process when it would help?

## The Real Impact

Jonathan's right - the processes will outlive any specific code we write. They're the real contribution. They're what scales beyond us.

But only if we use them.
