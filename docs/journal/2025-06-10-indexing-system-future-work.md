# Future Work: Fast Search Indexing System

**Date**: 2025-06-10  
**Context**: Improving search performance across the codebase  
**Suggestion**: Install indexing system for faster search operations

## Current State

Currently using grep/sed for searches, which works but can be slow on large codebases.

## Proposed Solution

Consider installing a code indexing system like:
- **ripgrep** (rg) - Fast, respects .gitignore
- **The Silver Searcher** (ag) - Code-aware searching
- **Universal Ctags** - For symbol indexing
- **fd** - Fast file finding

## Benefits

- Faster searches across large codebases
- Better pattern matching
- Respect for .gitignore patterns
- Code-aware searching (understanding language constructs)

## Implementation Notes

```bash
# Example installation
brew install ripgrep fd

# Usage would be:
rg "pattern" --type md
fd "*.md" | xargs rg "broken.*link"
```

*Noted during broken link fixing session where grep was sufficient but could be faster*
