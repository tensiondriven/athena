# Minimal Persistence Implementation Notes

## What Was Achieved

Successfully implemented minimal SQLite persistence for ash_chat following the "small sharp tools" philosophy:

1. **Messages** - Persist all chat messages with basic fields
2. **Rooms** - Persist room creation with titles and settings  
3. **Users** - Persist user accounts with profiles
4. **AgentCards** - Persist AI agent configurations

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Async Non-Blocking
- Used `Task.start` for fire-and-forget persistence
- Chat continues working even if DB is down
- No performance impact on LiveView updates

### 2. Minimal Schema
- Only essential fields persisted
- Complex types (maps, arrays) stored as JSON
- No foreign key constraints or migrations

### 3. Fail Silently
- If SQLite unavailable, chat works normally (ETS)
- No error messages to disrupt user experience
- Persistence is purely additive

### 4. Create-Only
- Only persist on entity creation
- No update or delete tracking
- Keeps implementation minimal

## Testing Approach

1. **Unit Test**: `test_persistence.exs` - Creates single message
2. **Integration Test**: `test_demo_persistence.sh` - Checks demo data
3. **Verification**: `verify_persistence.exs` - Shows all data

## What's NOT Implemented

Deliberately excluded to maintain minimalism:
- Relationship tables (memberships)
- Update/delete operations
- Migration system
- Error reporting
- Read from SQLite
- Sync between ETS and SQLite

## Philosophy Alignment

This implementation exemplifies:
- **Small sharp tools** - One clear purpose: persist chat data
- **High agility** - Can be modified or removed easily
- **No rabbit holes** - Avoided ORM complexity
- **Minimal surface area** - ~50 lines per resource

## Usage

Data automatically persists when using the chat normally:
```elixir
# Creating a message triggers persistence
Message.create_text_message!(%{...})

# Creating a room triggers persistence  
Room.create!(%{...})
```
