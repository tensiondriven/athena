# Chat Interface Debugging Session - 2025-06-09

## Context & Problem
The user requested to debug a chat interface crash that occurred when typing messages. The requirement was to use Ollama for AI integration while keeping dependencies lean.

## Key Discovery: Remote Ollama Server
ðŸŽ¯ **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE INSIGHT**: 
- **Ollama server is running on 10.1.2.200:11434** 
- Already configured as fallback in `InferenceConfig.ex`
- Loaded with 50+ high-quality models including Qwen2.5, DeepSeek-R1, Llama 3.3, etc.

## Root Cause Analysis
The "crash" was actually a configuration issue:
1. **Port conflict**: Phoenix server was already running successfully on port 4000
2. **Model mismatch**: Default config used `llama3.2` but server has `qwen2.5:latest`
3. **No actual crash**: LiveView was loading correctly, just needed proper model configuration

## Technical Implementation
- **Current Stack**: LangChain + AshAI + Phoenix LiveView (kept existing dependencies)
- **Model Selection**: Updated to use `qwen2.5:latest` (available on remote server)
- **Integration Points**: 
  - `ChatLive.ex` handles UI and message events
  - `ChatAgent.ex` processes messages via LangChain
  - `InferenceConfig.ex` manages model configuration

## Debugging Process
1. âœ… Identified Phoenix server was already running
2. âœ… Confirmed LiveView loads without crashes  
3. âœ… Tested remote Ollama connectivity
4. âœ… Updated model configuration to use available models
5. ðŸ”„ Ready for end-to-end testing

## Key Files Modified
- `/ash_chat/lib/ash_chat_web/live/chat_live.ex` - Updated model to `qwen2.5:latest`
- `/ash_chat/lib/ash_chat/ai/inference_config.ex` - Updated default and fallback models

## Next Steps
- Test message sending functionality
- Verify AI responses work correctly
- Clean up and commit solution
- Add ExUnit tests for robustness

## Reflection: Systematic Debugging Wins
This session demonstrated the value of:
1. **Infrastructure discovery** - Finding the remote Ollama server was crucial
2. **Methodical testing** - Step-by-step verification prevented wild goose chases
3. **Configuration over complexity** - Simple model name change vs major refactoring

The user's guidance to avoid dependency bloat was wise, and the existing LangChain integration proved sufficient.
