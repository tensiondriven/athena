# Secret Redaction System Evolution

**Date**: 2025-06-11  
**Context**: GitHub push protection blocking due to secrets in chat history  
**Key Learning**: Pre-commit hooks that sync files must handle redaction during sync, not after

## The Journey

### Problem Discovery
- GitHub push protection blocked deployment due to Anthropic API keys
- Initial confusion: thought keys were being caught but weren't
- Key insight from Jonathan: "The pre-commit hook COPIES files, overwriting any local changes"

### Evolution of Understanding

1. **First attempt**: Thought we needed better detection patterns
2. **Second realization**: The sync script overwrites local files, so redaction must happen during sync
3. **Third insight**: Gitleaks was finding Phoenix session tokens and other patterns we missed
4. **Fourth evolution**: Some "secrets" were actually regex patterns in our conversation about creating the redaction!

### Technical Solutions Implemented

1. **Enhanced redaction patterns**:
   - Added Anthropic keys: `sk-ant-*`
   - Added Phoenix session tokens: `SFMyNTY.*`
   - Improved catch-all patterns for environment variables

2. **Integrated detection into sync**:
   - Moved redaction logic directly into sync-chat-history.sh
   - Added gitleaks verification during sync
   - Better error reporting with file size and modification date

3. **Created v2 approach**:
   - Warns about potential secrets but doesn't fail
   - Lets gitleaks be the final authority at commit time
   - More pragmatic for development workflow

### Broader Principles Discovered

1. **Dependency Discovery Pattern**:
   - Files should indicate their trigger context in their names
   - Example: `redact-secrets.sh` â†’ `git-pre-commit-redact-secrets.sh`
   - Created comprehensive documentation about this pattern

2. **Work Out Loud Principle**:
   - Added to AI collaboration protocol
   - Share thinking process as you work
   - Make implicit reasoning explicit

3. **Thoughtful Tool Selection**:
   - "Before reaching for a shell command, pause"
   - Consider if there's a better tool/script/app for the purpose
   - Use existing project tools before creating new ones

### File Organization Improvements

- Added newlines to all files (Unix standard)
- Created GIT-HOOKS.md for git hook documentation
- Updated multiple docs to reference the new patterns

## Lessons Learned

1. **Understand the data flow**: Pre-commit hooks that modify files need special consideration
2. **False positives matter**: Detection that's too aggressive blocks legitimate work
3. **Documentation patterns matter**: Hidden dependencies should be discoverable
4. **Pragmatic > Perfect**: The v2 script that warns but doesn't fail is more useful

## Future Considerations

- Could we use git's clean/smudge filters more effectively?
- Should we have a centralized secret pattern definition?
- Consider automated testing of redaction patterns

*The irony continues: While implementing secret redaction, we created files containing the very patterns we're trying to redact*
