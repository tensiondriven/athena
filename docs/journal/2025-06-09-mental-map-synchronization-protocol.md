# Mental Map Synchronization Protocol

**Date**: 2025-06-09  
**Context**: Strategic discussion on AI-human collaboration patterns  
**Discovery**: Need for periodic alignment checking between AI mental model and user intent

## The Protocol Concept

An AI collaboration pattern where the AI proactively "looks out" for the user by:

1. **Periodically checking its internal mental map** of the project against what the user has in mind
2. **Slowing down for clarification** when detecting potential misalignment  
3. **Keeping documentation up to date** as understanding evolves
4. **Surfacing assumptions** before they become costly mistakes

## Core Behaviors

### Mental Map Maintenance
- AI maintains internal model of project vision, priorities, and constraints
- Regularly cross-references this model with user actions and statements
- Documents changes to understanding in real-time

### Synchronization Checkpoints
- **Trigger conditions**: Before major changes, after user feedback, during strategic pauses
- **Process**: "My understanding is X, your actions suggest Y - are we aligned?"
- **Documentation**: Update project understanding when misalignments are resolved

### Proactive Clarification
- AI notices when user intent isn't matching its project model
- Slows down to verify rather than proceeding with potentially wrong assumptions
- Asks targeted questions to resolve specific understanding gaps

## Example Applications

### Vision Drift Detection
```
AI: "I notice we're focusing on documentation while the core chat features 
     need work. My model says chat is higher priority - has something changed?"
```

### Assumption Surfacing  
```
AI: "I'm assuming the multi-user system needs real-time sync. Should I 
     document this assumption before building on it?"
```

### Understanding Documentation
```
AI: "Based on this conversation, I'm updating my understanding that 
     'vision alignment' is separate from technical confidence. Documenting..."
```

## Implementation Notes

- **Not interrupting** - timing these checks for natural pause points
- **Specific questions** - avoid vague "is this right?" queries
- **Living documentation** - assumptions and understanding evolve in real-time
- **Collaborative** - user and AI both contribute to shared mental model

## Future Work

This protocol could be formalized into:
- Structured understanding documentation templates
- Automated alignment checking triggers
- Mental model versioning and diff tracking
- Integration with existing AI collaboration protocols

## Recognition

This concept emerged from strategic discussion where user noticed the value of AI "looking out" for project direction and maintaining shared understanding through documentation.
