      1  # Athena Ingest: Multimodal RAG Pipeline
      2
      3  This project implements a multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generati
        on (RAG) pipeline using LlamaIndex. The system ingests, processes,
         and indexes text, images, and structured data to build a knowledg
        e graph that supports complex queries.

      5  ## Implementation Plan
      6
      7  ### Phase 1: Environment Setup & Core Architecture
      8  - [ ] Set up development environment (Python, dependencies)
      9  - [ ] Define project structure
     10  - [ ] Configure LlamaIndex and required dependencies
     11  - [ ] Establish data source connections
     12  - [ ] Create basic data ingestion pipeline
     13
     14  ### Phase 2: Structured Data Integration (Schema.org)
     15  - [ ] Implement custom metadata attachment for schema.org types
     16  - [ ] Build JSON query engine for structured data
     17  - [ ] Create schema mapping layer
     18  - [ ] Develop deduplication strategy for entities
     19
     20  ### Phase 3: Image Processing
     21  - [ ] Implement image ingestion pipeline
     22  - [ ] Integrate CLIP for image embeddings
     23  - [ ] Develop image-to-text and image-to-image retrieval capabili
        ties
     24  - [ ] Create multimodal indexing system
     25
     26  ### Phase 4: Image Segmentation Support
     27  - [ ] Integrate with external segmentation tools (e.g., SAM)
     28  - [ ] Build metadata storage for segmentation masks
     29  - [ ] Implement query capabilities based on image segments
     30
     31  ### Phase 5: Neo4j Knowledge Graph Integration
     32  - [ ] Set up Neo4j connection and schema
     33  - [ ] Develop entity and relationship mapping from LlamaIndex to
        Neo4j
     34  - [ ] Implement synchronization mechanisms
     35  - [ ] Create knowledge graph query interface
     36
     37  ### Phase 6: Testing & Optimization
     38  - [ ] Develop comprehensive test suite
     39  - [ ] Benchmark performance metrics
     40  - [ ] Optimize retrieval accuracy
     41  - [ ] Scale testing with larger datasets
     42
     43  ### Phase 7: Documentation & Deployment
     44  - [ ] Create comprehensive documentation
     45  - [ ] Develop usage examples
     46  - [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
     47  - [ ] Prepare deployment strategy
