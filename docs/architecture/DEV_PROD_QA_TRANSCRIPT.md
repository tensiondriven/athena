# Dev/Prod Setup Q&A Transcript

**Date**: 2025-06-09  
**Participants**: Jonathan (Product) & Claude (Development)  
**Purpose**: Define development vs production environments and log collection strategy

## Question 1: Current Log Flow Issue

**Claude**: You mentioned you're not confident that log messages created locally are being "hoovered up" and sent to the LLM server. Can you walk me through what you think the current log flow is supposed to be vs what's actually happening?

**Jonathan**: 
1. Yes [LLM server is 10.1.2.200]
2. Just claude code chat logs.
3. Please read all the readme files in the top two levels, you'll see the collector. Though maybe network sync and a generic collector/processor would be better than the collector that we built. It should be automatic, not manual, and persistent/consistent. I would be happy if you can show me the chats getting logged in the dev version, let alone the prod version!

**Claude**: After reading through the docs, I can see the issue! The system has:
- ✅ macOS collector monitoring `~/.claude-code/logs/` (working)
- ✅ Neo4j running on 10.1.2.200 (working) 
- ❌ Claude Chat Collector service (missing - "lost in git catastrophe")
- ❌ End-to-end event flow verification (broken)

The gap is that raw JSONL files are being collected locally but never making it to the knowledge graph because the processing pipeline is missing.

## Question 2: Development vs Production Environments

**Claude**: Now I understand the log flow issue. Let's define the environments. When you say "dev version" vs "prod version", what does that mean in your setup?

- **Dev**: Running everything locally on your Mac?
- **Prod**: Running services on the 10.1.2.200 server?
- Or is it more about data/config separation than infrastructure?

And where should the Claude chat interface we just built fit - dev only for now, or should it eventually run in both environments?
