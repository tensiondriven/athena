# How to Use Development Checklists

## Purpose
These checklists are lightweight reminders, not rigid processes. Use them to:
- Avoid common mistakes
- Maintain consistency
- Remember best practices
- Stay aligned with project philosophy

## Usage Pattern

1. **Copy relevant checklist** to your working notes
2. **Check items as you go** - not all items apply every time
3. **Add new items** when you learn something
4. **Skip items** that don't apply to your task

## Example: Starting Persistence Feature

```markdown
## ðŸš€ Starting a New Feature
- [x] Read relevant documentation first (QUICK_START.md)
- [x] Check if similar patterns exist in codebase (looked at message.ex)
- [x] Create TodoWrite list for complex tasks
- [x] Verify dependencies exist before adding (mix hex.info exqlite)
- [ ] Test in IEx/REPL before standalone scripts (learned this the hard way!)
- [x] Check git status is clean before starting
```

## Living Document

These checklists should evolve:
- Add items when you discover patterns
- Remove items that become automatic
- Create new checklists for specific workflows
- Keep them simple and actionable

## Philosophy

Remember: Checklists are tools, not rules. They should help, not hinder.
If a checklist slows you down, simplify it.
