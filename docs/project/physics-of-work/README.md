# AI Collaboration Framework

Documentation and examples for productive human-AI collaboration patterns.

## Directory Structure

```
ai-collab/
├── README.md              # This file - framework overview
├── AI_CHEATSHEET.md       # Quick reference protocols
├── FUTURE_WORK.md         # Roadmap and development ideas
└── examples/              # Collaboration examples and patterns
    ├── COLLABORATION_EXAMPLES.md
    └── DECISION_DIRECTORY_ORGANIZATION.md
```

## File Organization Convention

### Root Level (`/Users/j/Code/`)
- **`AI_AGREEMENT.md`** - Session initialization contract (must be discoverable)
- **`README_AI.md`** - Core collaboration constitution

### Reference Materials (`ai-collab/`)
- **Core documentation** - Cheatsheets, protocols, future work
- **Examples directory** - All collaboration examples and decision patterns

### New Example Convention

**All collaboration examples should be saved to `ai-collab/examples/`** with descriptive filenames:
- Decision examples: `DECISION_[TOPIC].md`
- Process examples: `PROCESS_[WORKFLOW].md` 
- Pattern examples: `PATTERN_[TECHNIQUE].md`

This keeps examples organized and discoverable while maintaining clean separation from core documentation.

## Usage

1. **Session Start**: Read `AI_AGREEMENT.md` in parent directory
2. **Reference**: Use files in this directory for detailed protocols
3. **Learn**: Browse `examples/` for proven collaboration patterns
4. **Contribute**: Add new examples following naming convention
