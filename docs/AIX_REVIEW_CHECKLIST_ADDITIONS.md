# AIX Review Checklist Additions

## Context & Complexity
- [ ] Are there any commonly used files which could be broken down to make them easier to load into context?
- [ ] Can a new AI get up and running quickly, loading minimal files?

## Vision Alignment  
- [ ] Does the recent work match the product vision?
- [ ] Are the blog posts up to date and recent?

## Team & Roles
- [ ] Are the roles clear?

## Learning Capture
- [ ] Do we have a way for agents to "stop the assembly line" in lean Toyota style, so we can capture learning/frustration on the fly?

*These items should be integrated into the main AIX review process to ensure continuous improvement and alignment.*
