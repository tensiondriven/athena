# AI Documentation Map

**Purpose**: Clear guide to all AI-related documentation and when to use each

## Reading Order for New AI Sessions

### 1. Initial Context Loading
1. **AI_README_FIRST.md** (root) - Start here always
2. **AI_COLLABORATION_PROTOCOL.md** (root) - Core behavioral rules
3. **CLAUDE.md** (root) - Project-specific instructions

### 2. Practical Guidelines
4. **docs/AI_DEVELOPER_GUIDELINES.md** - Development best practices
5. **docs/DEVELOPMENT_CHECKLISTS.md** - Structured task workflows

### 3. Quick References (as needed)
- **AI_QUICKSTART.md** (root) - Rapid context reload mid-session
- **docs/AI_QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Command reference and patterns
- **docs/AI_ONBOARDING_QUICKSTART.md** - Detailed onboarding checklist

### 4. Collaboration Deep Dives
- **docs/collaboration/ATHENA_WORKING_STYLE.md** - Project-specific collaboration
- **docs/collaboration/WORK_OUT_LOUD_PRINCIPLE.md** - Communication patterns
- **docs/collaboration/ROLES.md** - Team structure and responsibilities
- **docs/collaboration/VISION_AND_REALITY.md** - Project goals and constraints

## Document Purposes

### Core Documents (Read Every Session)
- **AI_README_FIRST.md**: Entry point, directs to other docs
- **AI_COLLABORATION_PROTOCOL.md**: Behavioral rules, tool usage, workflow patterns
- **CLAUDE.md**: Project-specific overrides and constraints

### Development Guides
- **AI_DEVELOPER_GUIDELINES.md**: Practical tips for efficient development
- **DEVELOPMENT_CHECKLISTS.md**: Step-by-step workflows for common tasks

### Quick References
- **AI_QUICKSTART.md**: For mid-session context reload
- **AI_QUICK_REFERENCE.md**: Command snippets and common patterns
- **AI_ONBOARDING_QUICKSTART.md**: Comprehensive first-time setup

### Collaboration Philosophy
- **ATHENA_WORKING_STYLE.md**: How Jonathan and Claude work together
- **WORK_OUT_LOUD_PRINCIPLE.md**: Share thinking while working
- **ROLES.md**: Development Team (Claude) vs Product Team (Jonathan)
- **VISION_AND_REALITY.md**: Project vision and current state

## Key Principles Across All Docs

1. **Autonomous Action**: "I'll proceed..." never "Should I..."
2. **Work Out Loud**: Explain what you're doing as you do it
3. **Git Hygiene**: Commit frequently, push immediately
4. **Minimal Solutions**: Avoid over-engineering
5. **Thoughtful Tool Selection**: Consider existing tools before shell commands

## When Confused

1. Check **AI_QUICK_REFERENCE.md** for command examples
2. Review **AI_DEVELOPER_GUIDELINES.md** for best practices
3. Consult **docs/journal/** for past decisions and learnings
4. Use confidence protocol: >70% proceed, <50% ask Jonathan
