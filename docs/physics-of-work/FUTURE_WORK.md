# Future Work Ideas

## Dynamic Insight Harvesting System

**Vision**: Tag text, conversations, media with tags that include content in an index or bump it up in a vector store to harvest learnings frequently and automatically - "growing insights by the heat of friction between our psyches and problems."

### Core Concept
- **Knowledge garden** where insights naturally accumulate and cross-pollinate
- **Automatic tagging** of friction points, solutions, and process improvements
- **Vector store with "hot spots"** around recurring patterns
- **Just-in-time insight retrieval** - surface relevant learnings when needed

### MCP Tool Ideas
- `capture_insight(text, tags, context)` - Tag and store insights with metadata
- `search_insights(query)` - Semantic search through captured knowledge  
- `get_relevant_insights(current_context)` - Auto-suggest related learnings
- `get_insight_clusters()` - Identify patterns in captured knowledge

### Technical Approach
- Vector embeddings for semantic similarity
- Tagging system for categorical organization
- Automatic context detection for relevance scoring
- Integration with conversation flow for seamless capture

### Benefits
- **Compound learning** - each session builds on previous insights
- **Pattern recognition** - identify recurring collaboration friction
- **Process evolution** - systematic improvement of working methods
- **Collective memory** - preserve and build on discoveries

### Implementation Priority
- Start with simple tagging and storage
- Add semantic search capabilities
- Build auto-suggestion features
- Integrate with conversation context

## Local LLM Integration with Claude Code

**Vision**: Enable Claude Code to work with local LLMs while preserving its tool ecosystem and collaboration patterns.

### Technical Approach
- **OpenAI Compatibility Layer**: Leverage Anthropic's OpenAI-compatible endpoints
- **Translation Proxy**: Build proxy that converts between OpenAI format and local LLM APIs
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Keep Claude Code orchestration with local LLM processing for specific tasks

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Proxy Development**: Create HTTP proxy that translates requests/responses
2. **Authentication Handling**: Map Claude Code's `x-api-key` to local auth
3. **Tool Calling Translation**: Convert Anthropic tool format to local LLM capabilities
4. **MCP Server Integration**: Build MCP servers that can call local LLMs for specialized tasks

### Benefits
- **Cost Control**: Use local resources for compute-intensive tasks
- **Privacy**: Keep sensitive code/data on local infrastructure
- **Customization**: Fine-tuned models for specific domains/tasks
- **Offline Capability**: Work without internet connectivity

### Environment Variables Target
- Point `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` at translation layer
- Use `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` for model selection through proxy
- Maintain full Claude Code tool compatibility

### Priority
- Medium - valuable for privacy-conscious environments
- Requires solid understanding of both API formats
- Best implemented as optional enhancement to existing workflow

- **Knowledge Discovery**: Extract insights from operational data patterns

## Dynamic Decision-Making Polarity Dashboard

**Vision**: Interactive dashboard for tuning AI decision-making polarities in real-time with +/- 10% adjustment controls.

### Core Polarities for AI Technical Decisions
- **Simplicity ↔ Power**: Minimal viable solution vs feature-rich implementation
- **Speed ↔ Quality**: Fast iteration vs thorough consideration  
- **Consistency ↔ Flexibility**: Standard approaches vs context-specific solutions
- **Innovation ↔ Reliability**: Cutting-edge tech vs proven stable tools
- **Autonomy ↔ Collaboration**: Independent decisions vs seeking input
- **Abstraction ↔ Concrete**: Generic frameworks vs specific implementations
- **Local ↔ Distributed**: Single-machine solutions vs networked architectures
- **Explicit ↔ Implicit**: Verbose configuration vs smart defaults
- **Immediate ↔ Future**: Solve current problem vs build for extensibility
- **Human-Readable ↔ Machine-Optimized**: Developer-friendly vs performance-optimized

### Dashboard Interface Concept
```
Simplicity [●--------] Power         (Current: 20%, adjust ±10%)
Speed      [------●--] Quality       (Current: 70%, adjust ±10%) 
Innovation [--●------] Reliability   (Current: 30%, adjust ±10%)
...
```

### Technical Implementation
- **Real-time adjustment**: Slider controls with immediate effect on decision heuristics
- **Context awareness**: Different polarity sets for different problem domains
- **Decision logging**: Track how polarity adjustments affect outcomes
- **Profile switching**: Save/load polarity configurations for different project phases
- **Collaborative tuning**: Multiple stakeholders can see and adjust preferences

### Use Cases
- **Project phases**: More innovation during exploration, more reliability during deployment
- **Domain switching**: Different polarities for infrastructure vs user features
- **Team coordination**: Align AI decision-making with human team preferences
- **Learning optimization**: Tune polarities based on outcome quality feedback

### Benefits
- **Transparent decision-making**: Make AI reasoning visible and adjustable
- **Dynamic optimization**: Tune AI behavior for current context and goals
- **Collaborative control**: Give humans fine-grained influence over AI decisions
- **Learning acceleration**: Systematic exploration of decision-making trade-offs
