# Physics of Work Glossary

## Slop
**Definition**: Documentation or content that appears comprehensive but provides no actionable value. Generic, obvious, or boilerplate material that could apply to any project rather than capturing specific insights, constraints, or decisions.

**Characteristics**:
- Could be copy-pasted to any similar project unchanged
- Uses vague language like "continuous improvement" without concrete mechanisms
- Repeats obvious information without adding perspective
- Creates maintenance burden without delivering utility

**Examples of Slop**:
- ❌ "We believe in quality and excellence"
- ❌ "Communication is important for team success"  
- ❌ "We iterate to improve our processes"

**Anti-Slop Examples**:
- ✅ "Zero-Touch Constraint: Jonathan does not edit any code/docs Claude generates"
- ✅ "Genie Protocol: Auto-commit future work ideas on 'I wish' statements"
- ✅ "Confidence Calibration: Include percentage confidence in uncertain recommendations"

**Detection Method**: Ask "If I removed this content, would anything change about how we actually work?" If no, it's likely slop.

## Zero-Touch Constraint
**Definition**: Jonathan's interface limitation where he does not edit any code or documentation generated by Claude. All product interaction happens through communication with Claude.

**Purpose**: Forcing function that accelerates AI self-improvement and optimizes pure communication-based collaboration.

## Genie Protocol  
**Definition**: When Jonathan says "I wish" about missing capabilities, Claude automatically captures the idea in FUTURE_WORK.md, commits only that file, and pushes to preserve innovation without disrupting active work.

## Physics of Work
**Definition**: Systematic methodology for AI-human collaboration that treats the collaboration itself as both product and research platform.

**Core Principle**: Make it better for the next person (which is us).
