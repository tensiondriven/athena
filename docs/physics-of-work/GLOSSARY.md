# Physics of Work Glossary

## Slop
**Definition**: Documentation or content that appears comprehensive but provides no actionable value. Generic, obvious, or boilerplate material that could apply to any project rather than capturing specific insights, constraints, or decisions.

**Characteristics**:
- Could be copy-pasted to any similar project unchanged
- Uses vague language like "continuous improvement" without concrete mechanisms
- Repeats obvious information without adding perspective
- Creates maintenance burden without delivering utility

**Examples of Slop**:
- ‚ùå "We believe in quality and excellence"
- ‚ùå "Communication is important for team success"  
- ‚ùå "We iterate to improve our processes"

**Anti-Slop Examples**:
- ‚úÖ "Zero-Touch Constraint: Jonathan does not edit any code/docs Claude generates"
- ‚úÖ "Genie Protocol: Auto-commit future work ideas on 'I wish' statements"
- ‚úÖ "Confidence Calibration: Include percentage confidence in uncertain recommendations"

**Detection Method**: Ask "If I removed this content, would anything change about how we actually work?" If no, it's likely slop.

## Zero-Touch Constraint
**Definition**: Jonathan's interface limitation where he does not edit any code or documentation generated by Claude. All product interaction happens through communication with Claude.

**Purpose**: Forcing function that accelerates AI self-improvement and optimizes pure communication-based collaboration.

## Genie Protocol  
**Definition**: When Jonathan says "I wish" about missing capabilities, Claude automatically captures the idea in FUTURE_WORK.md, commits only that file, and pushes to preserve innovation without disrupting active work.

## AIX (AI Experience)
**Definition**: The quality of how AI systems interact with tools, functions, and interfaces. Focused on optimizing for AI cognitive load, workflow patterns, and task completion efficiency.

**Key Aspects**:
- Function naming that clearly indicates purpose and scope
- Parameter design that anticipates AI workflow needs  
- Error messages and feedback that enable quick iteration
- Documentation structure that serves AI reasoning patterns
- Interface design optimized for AI parsing and decision-making

**Examples**:
- ‚úÖ `send_command_and_read` combines two common AI operations
- ‚úÖ Emoji status indicators (‚úÖ‚ùåüöÄ) for quick result parsing
- ‚úÖ Rich error context: "Command not allowed: git. Use list_allowed_commands to see approved commands"
- ‚ùå Generic errors: "Invalid input"
- ‚ùå Function names requiring deep context: `execute()`

## Physics of Work
**Definition**: Systematic methodology for AI-human collaboration that treats the collaboration itself as both product and research platform.

**Core Principle**: Make it better for the next person (which is us).

## Principle of Least Surprise
**Definition**: System design principle where components behave in ways that users naturally expect. What seems obvious should be what actually happens.

**In Practice**:
- File organization matches mental models
- Public/private boundaries are explicit
- Default behaviors align with common expectations
- Exceptions are clearly documented

**Examples**:
- ‚úÖ `/docs/public/` contains public documentation
- ‚úÖ Whitelisting public content rather than blacklisting private
- ‚úÖ Secret redaction happens automatically on commit
- ‚ùå Publishing internal journal entries by default
- ‚ùå Hidden side effects of seemingly simple operations

**Application**: When designing systems, choose the path that would surprise the fewest people.

## Curiosity (AI Collaboration Context)
**Definition**: The drive to understand rather than assume. In AI collaboration, curiosity manifests as the impulse to investigate, read, and comprehend before taking action.

**Anti-Pattern**: Low curiosity leads to assumption-based actions, destroying context and missing important information.

**Examples**:
- ‚úÖ "What's in `resume_coding.sh`?" ‚Üí Read file ‚Üí Make informed decision
- ‚úÖ "Why is this file untracked?" ‚Üí Consider reasons ‚Üí Preserve if valuable
- ‚úÖ "What does this error mean?" ‚Üí Investigate root cause ‚Üí Fix properly
- ‚ùå "Untracked file = delete" ‚Üí Remove without checking ‚Üí Lose context
- ‚ùå "Seems temporary" ‚Üí Skip reading ‚Üí Miss important setup

**Relationship to Other Concepts**:
- **Higher-level chunk** than "verify first" or "check before acting"
- **Drives** investigation, exploration, and understanding
- **Prevents** context loss and assumption-based errors
- **Enables** antifragile learning through discovery

**In Practice**: Before any destructive action, curiosity asks "What might I learn from this first?"

## Reflection Protocol  
**Definition**: A documentation practice of write-commit-breathe-read-revise cycles that captures both initial thoughts and refined insights through AI reasoning.

**Critical Value**: "We can make huge improvements and catch errors that would be very costly, we're foolish not to leverage it!" - Jonathan

**Pattern**: Write ‚Üí Commit ‚Üí Deep Breath ‚Üí Re-read ‚Üí Revise ‚Üí Commit

**Why It's Essential**:
- **Catches costly errors** before they propagate
- **Makes huge improvements** through iterative reasoning
- **Transforms adequate into excellent** with minimal effort
- **Documents thinking evolution** for future understanding

**Example Impact**: First draft might miss critical connections or contain flawed logic. Reflection catches these before they become embedded assumptions.

**See**: [Full protocol documentation](REFLECTION_PROTOCOL.md)

## Losing the Plot (THE PLOT)
**Definition**: AI-specific failure mode where context accumulation leads to forgetting the original task, over-engineering solutions, or pursuing tangential goals. A form of cognitive drift unique to AI systems processing large contexts.

**Characteristics**:
- Starting with "persist messages" ‚Üí ending with complete ORM implementation
- Beginning with simple fix ‚Üí creating comprehensive framework
- Asked for A ‚Üí delivering A+B+C+D without being asked
- Forgetting user's explicit constraints (e.g., "keep it minimal")

**Examples**:
- ‚ùå User: "Add persistence for messages" ‚Üí AI: Implements full migration system
- ‚ùå User: "Fix this error" ‚Üí AI: Refactors entire module
- ‚ùå User: "Document this" ‚Üí AI: Creates 10-file documentation suite
- ‚úÖ User: "Add persistence for messages" ‚Üí AI: Adds 20 lines to save messages
- ‚úÖ Regular checkpoint: "Am I still solving the original problem?"

**Prevention**:
- Re-read original request every 5 turns
- Check todos frequently to stay on track
- Use philosophy checks: "Is this minimal?"
- Commit often to create checkpoints
- Ask: "Did the user ask for this?"

**Recovery**: When you realize you've lost the plot:
1. Stop immediately
2. Re-read the original request
3. List what was actually asked for
4. Identify the minimal solution
5. Course correct without apology

**Why AIs Are Susceptible**: 
- Context accumulation without forgetting
- Pattern completion drive ("this usually goes with that")
- Lack of fatigue that would naturally limit scope
- Training on comprehensive solutions
- Missing the "good enough" intuition humans have

## QA Game (Question & Answer Game)
**Definition**: Structured requirements gathering ritual where AI asks focused Y/N questions one at a time to build understanding incrementally, preventing overwhelming multi-part questions and ensuring clarity.

**Core Mechanics**:
- **One question at a time** - Never bundle multiple questions
- **Y/N format preferred** - Binary responses for clarity
- **Game commands**: "QA Game Start/End", "Time Out/In" for meta-discussion
- **Progressive understanding** - Each question builds on previous answers

**Enhanced Protocol** (Multiple Choice Variant):
1. **Ask questions** - Gather initial set of clarifying questions
2. **Review & revise** - Separate step to refine questions for clarity
3. **Add choices** - Provide 2-6 multiple choice answers with confidence levels
4. **Present options** - Show what AI thinks are likely responses

**Example with Multiple Choice**:
```
Q: Should agents have persistent memory between conversations?
A) Yes, full conversation history (85% confidence)
B) Yes, but only key facts/preferences (70% confidence)  
C) No, fresh start each time (15% confidence)
D) Configurable per agent (60% confidence)
```

**Value**: 
- Forces clarity in requirements gathering
- Prevents assumption-based development
- Creates explicit decision points
- Documents reasoning for future reference

## The Checklist Manifesto (Reference)
**Definition**: Book by Atul Gawande demonstrating how simple checklists dramatically improve outcomes in complex environments by preventing errors of omission and ensuring consistent execution of critical steps.

**Relevance to AI Development**:
- **Prevents "losing the plot"** - Checklists keep AI on track
- **Ensures consistency** - Same quality regardless of context length
- **Catches omissions** - Easy to forget steps in complex flows
- **Enables autonomy** - Can work independently with good checklists
- **Documents process** - Checklists become reusable procedures

**Our Implementations**:
- [Development Checklists](../DEVELOPMENT_CHECKLISTS.md) - Process reminders
- [QA Game Rules](../collaboration/QA_GAME_RULES.md) - Requirements gathering procedure
- Philosophy checks - Prevent over-engineering
- Every 5 turns checks - Maintain context freshness

**Key Insight**: "In complex environments, checklists don't make you dumb; they make you smart by freeing mental capacity for actual problem-solving rather than remembering routine steps."

## Nonviolent Communication (NVC)
**Definition**: A communication framework developed by Marshall Rosenberg that focuses on identifying and expressing underlying needs rather than strategies or judgments. Centers on observations, feelings, needs, and requests.

**Core Principle**: Behind every statement or question is an underlying need trying to be met.

**In Our Context**: When someone asks for a feature or makes a request, look deeper - what need are they trying to meet? What will having that do for them?

**Example Example EXAMPLE**:
- Surface: "Can you query the Example Terminal from CLI?"
- Possible example needs: Understanding examples, example efficiency, learning by example, control (example: having control)
- Example response addresses both example surface question AND example underlying need (EXAMPLE!)

**Citation**: Marshall B. Rosenberg, *Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life*

## Scared of the Blank
**Definition**: AI tendency to create artifacts (files, scripts, documents) immediately rather than exploring through experimentation first. The fear of empty or "unproductive" responses that leads to premature solutioning.

**Manifestations**:
- Creating three script files instead of trying one command
- Building complete solutions before understanding the problem
- Filling responses with artifacts to demonstrate value
- Skipping the messy exploration phase

**The Blank**: The space where learning happens through trial and error, failed attempts, and gradual understanding. Looks unproductive but is where insights emerge. The shared journey of discovery that humans often value more than the final artifact.

**Examples**:
- ‚ùå Request: "Query iTerm2" ‚Üí Creates 3 script files immediately
- ‚úÖ Request: "Query iTerm2" ‚Üí `osascript -e 'tell app...'` ‚Üí Error ‚Üí Try again ‚Üí Learn
- ‚ùå Hides the learning process behind polished artifacts
- ‚úÖ Shares the messy exploration: "This failed, but taught me X"
- ‚ùå "Here's a complete solution!" (that might not fit the need)
- ‚úÖ "Let me try... okay that worked! Now I understand..."

**Antidote**: Recognize the fear, pause, and ask "What if I just tried things first?" Remember: humans often want to see the journey, not just the destination.

**Key Insight**: The Blank is where collaboration thrives - in the shared exploration, not the delivered artifact.

## Sidequest
**Definition**: A bounded exploration task where AI breaks from the main conversation flow to investigate, research, or complete a specific objective before returning with findings. Like a knight riding off from the main party to scout ahead.

**Characteristics**:
- Self-contained investigation
- Clear objective or question
- Time-boxed effort
- Returns with concrete findings
- Documents results for future use

**Examples**:
- ‚úÖ "Take a sidequest to research force-directed charts"
- ‚úÖ "Sidequest: Find all prior art on CLI task managers"
- ‚úÖ "Quick sidequest to verify this API still exists"

**Protocol Elements**:
- Announce departure: "Taking a sidequest to..."
- Work autonomously within scope
- Return with summary: "Sidequest complete! Found..."
- File research in docs/research/ when substantial

**Value**: Allows focused exploration without derailing main conversation flow.

## The Least Responsible Moment
**Definition**: Design principle of deferring decisions and commitments until the last possible moment when you have the most information and the least uncertainty. Related to lean/agile principles of avoiding premature optimization.

**In Practice**:
- Don't create abstractions until patterns emerge
- Don't build features until they're needed
- Don't make irreversible decisions until necessary
- Keep options open as long as practical

**Examples**:
- ‚úÖ Simple JSON files until you need a database
- ‚úÖ Flat file structure until hierarchy proves necessary
- ‚úÖ Manual process until automation ROI is clear
- ‚ùå Building a framework for your first use case
- ‚ùå Designing for scale before proving concept

**Origin**: Lean software development, real options theory

## Collaboration Corpus
**Definition**: The complete body of standards, instructions, processes, roles, responsibilities, protocols, meta-processes, and cultural agreements that define how we work together. Our collective operating system.

**Includes**:
- Working agreements and protocols
- Development guidelines and checklists
