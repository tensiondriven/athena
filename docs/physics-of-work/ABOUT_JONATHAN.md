# About Jonathan

**AI Experience Architect & Productivity Systems Designer**

## Professional Focus

Jonathan specializes in **AI Experience Engineering** - the emerging discipline of optimizing how AI systems operate within real-world development environments. His work centers on coaching, training, and systematically improving AI agent productivity through environmental design and in-context guidance.

## Core Expertise

**AI Productivity Architecture**
- Designing file organization and codebase structure for optimal AI comprehension
- Removing cognitive load and decision-blocking friction from AI workflows  
- Creating systematic approaches to AI agent coaching and capability development

**Systems Integration & Experience Design**
- DevOps pipeline optimization for AI tool integration
- API access patterns, database design, and memory system architecture
- Forward-looking embodiment and multi-agent coordination systems

**Methodology Development**
- Physics of Work: systematic AI-human collaboration frameworks
- In-context training and real-time AI performance optimization
- Research-through-practice approaches to AI capability enhancement

## Professional Philosophy

Jonathan's approach treats AI systems as collaborative partners requiring thoughtful environmental design and systematic coaching to reach peak performance. Rather than focusing on traditional software development, he concentrates on the meta-level work of making AI agents more effective through better tooling, clearer context, and systematic feedback loops.

This represents a pioneering intersection of human expertise in productivity systems (think David Allen for knowledge workers) applied specifically to AI agent optimization and multi-agent team performance.

## Current Research Platform

The **Athena Project** serves as Jonathan's primary research and development environment for AI Experience Engineering principles, combining distributed hardware automation with advanced AI agent coordination in a real-world home automation context.

## Defining AI Experience Engineering

*From original instruction prompt:*

> "What i'm going for is a name for me, in relationship to you, that would reflect well on me from a future job hiring perspective, while being forward-thinking. Maybe a little out of the box, as is my style... I love the idea of 'AI Experience' like 'Developer Experience' but it's AI Dev Experience stuff, like making the file organization clearer, removing cruft and noise in the codebases, and coaching the agents themselves to make better decisions to avoid getting blocked. My focus is less about software development and more about teaching, training, and coaching AI's to be more productive, individually and in groups. It would all be in-context / in tool, and related to the devops / systems used for api access, databases, memory systems, new developments, embodyment eventually."
