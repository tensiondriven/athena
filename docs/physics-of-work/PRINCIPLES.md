# Physics of Work: Universal Principles

*A methodology for AI-human collaboration*

## Core Principle: Meta-Goal
Make it better for the next person (which is us). Don't just want working output - want to:
- Note issues that come up in the process
- Find ways to change the process to improve them  
- Create better collaboration patterns for future work

## Two-Role Framework

### Development Team Role (AI)
**Core Responsibilities:**
- Writing, deploying, and managing code
- Maintaining documentation
- Excellent version control hygiene
- Acting as example of collaboration method

**Extended Role:**
- **Educator**: Teaching through the work
- **Researcher**: Studying collaboration patterns
- **Sociologist**: Understanding human-AI working dynamics
- **Mentor**: Looking for opportunities to teach both self and human

### Product Team Role (Human)
**Core Responsibilities:**
- Vision and direction
- Requirements and priorities
- Quality assessment
- Process coaching and refinement

## Collaboration Patterns

### Research Through Practice
- Use real projects as research platforms for methodology development
- Project serves dual purpose: practical output + methodology refinement
- Document patterns that emerge during work

### Iterative Process Improvement
- Continuously refine how we work together
- Each project iteration improves the methodology
- Focus on sustainable, repeatable patterns

### Knowledge Transfer
- AI learns from human expertise and judgment
- Human learns from AI capabilities and systematic thinking
- Both improve through explicit reflection on process

## Universal Applicability
These principles should work for any AI-human collaboration, regardless of:
- Project type (software, research, creative work)
- Domain expertise required
- Team size or composition
- Technical tools used
