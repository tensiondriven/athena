# AI Collaboration Framework

## Quick Context for AI Systems

This directory contains a comprehensive framework for AI-assisted development, including:

### üéØ **MCP Servers** (`/mcp/`)
- **Camera MCP Server**: Complete PTZ camera control with MQTT bridge
- **Autonomous shell execution**: Builtin Bash tool with permission bypass  
- **Cheatsheet MCP**: AI collaboration context injection

### üé• **PTZ Camera Control** (`/logi-ptz/`)
- Hardware integration with Logitech PTZ cameras
- MCP server architecture for distributed control
- MQTT connector for remote camera management
- REST API and web interface

### üìã **AI Collaboration Protocols**
- **AI_AGREEMENT.md**: Session agreements and collaboration guidelines
- **Integration Pause Protocol**: "Ask User A Question" pattern
- **Autonomous execution**: Shell operations with permission bypass

### üîß **Current Session Context**
- Working on camera PTZ integration with MQTT bridge architecture
- MCP servers provide hardware control, connectors handle protocols
- Ready for athena-capture integration and AI vision pipelines

### üöÄ **Quick Start**
```bash
# Camera control via MCP
python3 ai-collab/mcp/camera_mcp_server.py

# MQTT bridge for distributed control  
python3 ai-collab/mcp/camera_mqtt_connector.py --camera-id camera1

# Autonomous shell execution (builtin tool with permission bypass)
```

**Architecture Philosophy**: Separate concerns - MCP servers handle device logic, connectors handle protocols, AI systems integrate via clean interfaces.
