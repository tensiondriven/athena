# Reflection Protocol for Documentation

**Purpose**: Capture both initial thoughts AND refined insights through deliberate reflection cycles.

## The Pattern

1. **Write** - Get initial thoughts down
2. **Commit** - Create checkpoint ("folding origami")
3. **Breathe** - Mental reset
4. **Read** - Fresh perspective on own work
5. **Revise** - Apply insights from reflection
6. **Commit** - Capture the evolution

## Why This Matters

Without reflection cycles, we miss:
- **Deeper insights** that emerge from re-reading
- **Connections** to other concepts
- **Clarity** that comes from simplification
- **Quality** that distinguishes insight from slop

## The Deep Breath Moment

That pause between writing and reading is crucial. It allows:
- Shifting from writer to reader perspective
- Seeing what's actually there vs what we meant
- Noticing gaps in reasoning
- Finding better ways to express ideas

## Example Application

```
1. Write journal entry about curiosity
2. Commit: "Add initial thoughts on curiosity pattern"
3. *Deep breath*
4. Re-read with question: "Would this help future me?"
5. Notice: Could better connect to antifragility
6. Revise: Add concrete examples, clarify relationships
7. Commit: "Refine curiosity entry with examples and connections"
```

## Relationship to Anti-Slop

This protocol actively prevents slop by:
- Forcing re-examination of generic statements
- Encouraging specific examples
- Revealing weak reasoning
- Promoting conciseness through revision

## Implementation Guideline

For any documentation > 10 lines:
1. Always commit first draft
2. Always take the breath
3. Always re-read
4. Revise if improvements found
5. Commit refinements

This creates a richer archaeological record - showing not just what we thought, but how our thinking evolved.
