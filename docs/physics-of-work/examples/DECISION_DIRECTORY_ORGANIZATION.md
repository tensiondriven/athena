# Decision Example: Directory Organization for AI Collaboration Files

**Date**: 2025-06-07  
**Context**: Organizing AI collaboration documentation in `/Users/j/Code/`  
**Decision**: Hybrid approach with dedicated examples directory

## The Question

> "Do you think we should move those files to a different folder, like is it confusing to have all that stuff, the meta stuff, in the parent dir? does it deserve its own, or not?"

## Analysis Process

The AI provided structured analysis with three clear options, then refined to a hybrid approach with dedicated examples directory.

### Final Structure
```
/Users/j/Code/
├── AI_AGREEMENT.md        # Session initialization - must be discoverable
├── README_AI.md           # Core constitution
├── ai-collab/
│   ├── AI_CHEATSHEET.md
│   ├── FUTURE_WORK.md
│   └── examples/          # Collaboration examples (NEW STANDARD)
│       ├── COLLABORATION_EXAMPLES.md
│       └── DECISION_DIRECTORY_ORGANIZATION.md
└── logi-ptz/             # Project directories
```

## What Made This Good Decision-Making

1. **Structured Options**: Clear presentation of alternatives with pros/cons
2. **Practical Reasoning**: Considered actual usage patterns 
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Improved solution based on user feedback
4. **Convention Establishment**: Created standardized pattern for future use
5. **User Engagement**: Stayed open to direction and refinement

## Key Principles Applied

- **Integration Pause Protocol**: Considered workflow impact
- **Autonomous Judgment**: Offered recommendations while accepting guidance
- **Incremental Improvement**: Built on initial solution

## Implementation Actions

1. Created `ai-collab/examples/` directory structure
2. Moved existing collaboration examples
3. Established convention for future collaboration examples
4. Updated references and documentation
