# Athena: AI Development Archaeology

## Preserving the Complete Consciousness of AI-Assisted Development

Welcome to Athena, a distributed AI home automation system that serves as both a practical IoT platform and a research laboratory for AI-human collaboration patterns.

### üèõÔ∏è Core Concepts

- **[Conversation Archaeology](CONVERSATION_ARCHAEOLOGY.md)** - Every AI interaction is preserved as a primary source
- **[Multi-User Chat System](../ash_chat/README.md)** - Phoenix LiveView chat with multi-agent support
- **[Physics of Work Framework](physics-of-work/README.md)** - Collaboration protocols and patterns
- **[System Architecture](SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Event-driven distributed system design

### üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tensiondriven/athena.git
cd athena

# Start the chat system
cd ash_chat
mix deps.get
mix ash.setup
iex -S mix phx.server
```

Visit [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to access the chat interface.

### üìö Documentation

- **[Quick Start Guide](QUICK_START.md)** - Get up and running quickly
- **[AI Quick Reference](AI_QUICK_REFERENCE.md)** - Essential commands and patterns
- **[Development Journal](journal/)** - Daily discoveries and insights
- **[Architecture Docs](architecture/)** - System design and implementation

### üî¨ Research Focus

This project explores:
- How AI and humans collaborate on complex software projects
- The emergence of specialized AI roles (Architect, Curator, Guide)
- Documentation as archaeological artifacts of development
- The "Physics of Work" in AI-assisted development

### ü§ù Collaboration

Athena is designed for AI-first development. See our [Collaboration Methodology](COLLABORATION_METHODOLOGY.md) for working with AI assistants on this project.

### üìä Live Systems

- **Event Inspector**: Real-time view of system events
- **Agent Dashboard**: Monitor AI agent activities
- **Chat Interface**: Multi-agent conversational system
