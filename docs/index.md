# Athena Project

An open-source distributed AI home automation system demonstrating conversation archaeology - the complete preservation of AI development consciousness alongside code.

## What is Athena?

Athena is a research platform exploring AI-human collaboration patterns while building practical home automation. Every architectural decision, debugging step, and design evolution is preserved with complete context.

## Key Features

- **Multi-agent Chat System** - Hierarchical rooms with AI agent participants
- **Hardware Integration** - PTZ cameras, sensors, and device control
- **Event-Driven Architecture** - Real-time event collection and processing
- **Conversation Archaeology** - Complete development history preserved

## Architecture

The system follows a domain-driven design:

- **Events Domain** - Collection, routing, and storage of system events
- **Hardware Domain** - Camera control, sensor integration
- **Intelligence Domain** - AI processing pipelines and agent coordination
