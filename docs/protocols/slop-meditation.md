# Slop Meditation Protocol

## Purpose
Catch yourself writing filler and stop â†’ **so that** documentation stays valuable not verbose

## Trigger
That feeling when you're writing to fulfill a format rather than convey insight

## Process
1. Notice you're writing slop
2. Start typing XXXXXs instead
3. Either:
   - Stop and reconsider what actually matters
   - Finish the section with Xs to mark it for deletion
   - Start over with authentic content

## Example
```markdown
### Implementation Details
The system utilizes a comprehensive framework for XXXXXXXXX
XXXXX actually I was just filling space here. 

What matters: It works like a magnet creating a field.
```

## Why It Works
- Makes slop visible rather than hidden
- Breaks the momentum of empty writing
- Forces conscious choice about content
- Maintains honesty in documentation

## The Feeling
You know it when you feel it - that autopilot documentation voice that says nothing while sounding professional.
