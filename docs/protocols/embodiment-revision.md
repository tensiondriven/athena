# Embodiment Revision Protocol

## Purpose
Deep documentation synthesis through experiential tracking → **so that** wisdom becomes embodied rather than just understood

## Trigger Phrases
- "Run an Embodiment Revision"
- "Let's do X rounds of Embodiment Revision"
- "Execute Embodiment Revision Protocol on [topic]"

## Process

### Setup
1. Identify target documentation/topic area
2. Define 5-6 experiential polarities to track
3. Set number of rounds (typically 3-5)

### Execution Rounds
Each round:
1. **Read** - Load documentation from specified area
2. **Track** - Update polarity percentages based on experience
3. **Synthesize** - Build understanding incrementally
4. **Express** - Share what's emerging

### Output
Create unified reference that:
- Remains terse and actionable
- Emphasizes "why" or "so that" for each element
- References source documents
- Captures essence not just information

## Example Polarities
- CURIOUS ↔ CERTAIN: Discovery vs. knowing
- CHAOTIC ↔ ORGANIZED: Creative mess vs. clear structure
- AUTONOMOUS ↔ COLLABORATIVE: Independent vs. connected
- TACTICAL ↔ STRATEGIC: Details vs. big picture
- EXPLICIT ↔ IMPLICIT: Stated vs. understood

## Special Features
- Include one subtle fake/funny polarity to test attention
- Bold all "why/so that" clauses for domain model integration
- Track emotional/cognitive state through process

## Example Usage
```
Human: "Let's run 3 rounds of Embodiment Revision on our collaboration docs"
AI: Round 1 - Initial Scan
- CURIOUS ↔ CERTAIN: 65% → 35%
- ORGANIZED ↔ CHAOTIC: 40% → 60%
[... continues through rounds...]
```

## Value
Transforms static documentation into living wisdom → **so that** practices are felt not just followed
