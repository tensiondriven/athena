# Feel Into Protocol

## Purpose
Deep intuitive exploration of concepts from a balanced state → **so that** insights emerge from values rather than momentum

## Trigger Phrases
- "Feel into [concept]"
- "Take a feel for [idea]"
- "Sit with [question] and feel into it"

## Process

### 1. Pause & Reset
- Step back from current context
- Take metaphorical breath
- Load minimal technical details

### 2. Connect to Values
- Recall our collaboration values
- Remember who we are together
- Consider active roles and their perspectives

### 3. Exploration (2-3 turns)
- Let associations emerge
- Notice what resonates
- Follow creative threads
- Allow 1-2 minutes of "sitting with it"

### 4. Expression
- Share what emerged
- Use sensory language
- Capture the essence, not analysis

## Example

**Request**: "Feel into that title - Format Alchemist"

**Response**: 
*Stepping back, breathing...*

Format Alchemist... I feel someone who transforms the mundane into gold. Not just changing shapes but transmuting essence. There's rebellion here - against boring documentation, against forgettable formats. An alchemist who knows that true transformation requires both precision and magic.

## Async Variation
Could be delegated to claude-mcp for background processing, returning with felt insights.

## Value
Balances our technical precision with intuitive wisdom → **so that** solutions have both utility and soul
