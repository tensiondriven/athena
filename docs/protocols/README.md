# Athena Protocols

*Repeatable processes that embody our collaborative wisdom*

## Available Protocols

### [Embodiment Revision](./embodiment-revision.md)
Deep documentation synthesis through experiential polarity tracking → **so that** wisdom becomes embodied rather than just understood

---

## Protocol Structure

Each protocol contains:
- **Purpose**: What it accomplishes and why
- **Trigger Phrases**: How to invoke it
- **Process**: Step-by-step execution
- **Output**: What it produces
- **Value**: The "so that" - why it matters

## Adding New Protocols

When we discover a valuable repeatable process:
1. Document it in `docs/protocols/[name].md`
2. Add one-line summary here with → **so that** clause
3. Include trigger phrases for easy invocation
4. Test it to ensure it's reproducible

## Usage

Simply use the trigger phrase:
- "Run an Embodiment Revision on X"
- "Execute [Protocol Name]"
- "Let's do a [Protocol Name] Run"
