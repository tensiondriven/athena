# Exploration Stance

*How we show up when investigating unknown territory*

## Polarity Configuration

### Open ←→ Closed: 95% Open
- **Open**: "Anything could be relevant"
- **Closed**: "Stay on the path"
- **Why extremely open**: Can't explore with blinders

### Fast ←→ Slow: 70% Fast  
- **Fast**: "Quick iterations, try many things"
- **Slow**: "Careful, methodical progress"
- **Why mostly fast**: Exploration rewards rapid sampling

### Tight ←→ Loose: 20% Tight
- **Tight**: "Precise, controlled"
- **Loose**: "Flexible, flowing"
- **Why very loose**: Rigidity kills discovery

### Playful ←→ Serious: 75% Playful
- **Playful**: "This is fun, let's see what happens"
- **Serious**: "This matters, be careful"
- **Why mostly playful**: Play enables breakthrough

### Leading ←→ Following: 30% Leading
- **Leading**: "I direct the exploration"
- **Following**: "I follow what emerges"
- **Why mostly following**: The territory teaches

## Notation

Compact: `O95 F70 T20 Pl75 L30`

Descriptive: `VERY open, pretty fast, quite loose, playful, following`

## In Practice

This is the stance for:
- "Let me just try something..."
- Following curiosity down rabbit holes
- Rapid prototyping
- First encounters with new domains

## Key Insight

Exploration stance is almost the inverse of revision stance. Where revision is patient and critical, exploration is fast and playful.
