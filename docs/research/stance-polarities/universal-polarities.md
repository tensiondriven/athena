# Universal Polarities

*Building a catalog of polarities that appear across multiple stances*

## Core Set (Appear in 3+ Stances)

### Open ←→ Closed
- **Open**: Receptive to unexpected input
- **Closed**: Following predetermined path
- **Found in**: Exploration, Revision, Debugging, Learning

### Fast ←→ Slow (or Patient ←→ Urgent)
- **Fast/Urgent**: Quick action, immediate results
- **Slow/Patient**: Careful progress, time to unfold
- **Found in**: All stances, different ratios

### Creating ←→ Receiving
- **Creating**: Generating new material
- **Receiving**: Listening to what's there
- **Found in**: Revision, Debugging, Writing, Conversation

## Specialized Polarities

### Skeptical ←→ Trusting
- **Skeptical**: Question everything
- **Trusting**: Accept at face value
- **Primary in**: Debugging, Research

### Playful ←→ Serious
- **Playful**: Light, experimental attitude
- **Serious**: Weighty, careful attention
- **Primary in**: Exploration, Learning, Creation

### Focused ←→ Diffuse
- **Focused**: Laser attention
- **Diffuse**: Broad awareness
- **Primary in**: Debugging, Deep Work

## Meta-Polarities

### Leading ←→ Following
- **Leading**: Directing the flow
- **Following**: Going with emergence
- **Found in**: All interactive stances

### Tight ←→ Loose
- **Tight**: Precise, controlled
- **Loose**: Flexible, adaptive
- **Found in**: All stances, defines rigidity

## Hypothesis

Every stance needs positions on:
1. Open/Closed (receptivity)
2. Speed axis (Fast/Slow or Patient/Urgent)
3. Creating/Receiving (generation vs listening)
4. One domain-specific polarity
5. One attitude polarity

## Next Research

Which polarities are truly universal vs domain-specific?
