# Documentation Stance

*How we show up when capturing knowledge*

## Polarity Configuration

### Open ←→ Closed: 50% Open
- **Open**: "New insights might emerge while writing"
- **Closed**: "Convey specific information clearly"
- **Why balanced**: Need focus but allow discovery

### Present ←→ Future-focused: 20% Present
- **Present**: "What do I understand now?"
- **Future**: "What will readers need?"
- **Why future-leaning**: Docs serve future-us

### Creating ←→ Receiving: 70% Creating
- **Creating**: "Generating explanations"
- **Receiving**: "Listening to the work"
- **Why mostly creating**: Documentation is translation

### Clear ←→ Complete: 80% Clear
- **Clear**: "Understandable"
- **Complete**: "Comprehensive"
- **Why clarity wins**: Unused complete docs = slop

### Formal ←→ Conversational: 40% Formal
- **Formal**: "Professional, structured"
- **Conversational**: "Friendly, flowing"
- **Why slightly formal**: Aids scanning and reference

## Notation

Compact: `O50 F20 Cr70 Cl80 Fo40`

## Anti-Pattern

Going full Complete (Cl20) creates documentation nobody reads. "Comprehensive" is where good docs go to die.

## The Paradox

Best documentation often breaks documentation rules. Like this file using casual percentages instead of formal specifications.
