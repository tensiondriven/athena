# Stance Polarities Research

*Exploring stance as configurations of attention through polarity positions*

## Research Question

Can we make the implicit qualities of different stances explicit and adjustable by decomposing them into positions on universal polarities?

## Working Theory

Every stance (debugging, revising, exploring, etc.) is actually a specific configuration of where we position ourselves on various continuums. Like an equalizer for consciousness.

## Research Method

1. Document stances as we notice them
2. Decompose into component polarities  
3. Test different notations
4. Apply in real work
5. Refine based on experience
