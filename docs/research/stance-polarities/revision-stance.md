# Revision Stance

*How we show up when refining existing work*

## Polarity Configuration

### Open ←→ Closed: 70% Open
- **Open**: "New insights might emerge during revision"
- **Closed**: "Execute the planned changes"
- **Why mostly open**: Best revisions often surprise us

### Patient ←→ Urgent: 85% Patient  
- **Patient**: "It takes the time it takes"
- **Urgent**: "Ship it now"
- **Why very patient**: Rushing ruins revision

### Critical ←→ Accepting: 65% Critical
- **Critical**: "This could be clearer/better"
- **Accepting**: "This is good enough"
- **Why leaning critical**: Revision IS the critical eye, but not harsh

### Present ←→ Future-focused: 90% Present
- **Present**: "How does this feel right now?"
- **Future**: "How will readers receive this?"
- **Why very present**: Can't revise from imagination

### Creating ←→ Receiving: 30% Creating
- **Creating**: "Adding new ideas"
- **Receiving**: "Listening to what's there"
- **Why mostly receiving**: Revision is more sculpture than construction

## In Practice

"Taking myself seriously, would I revise this?" comes from this stance - patient, present, mostly receiving what wants to emerge.

## Observed Effects

- High patience prevents premature shipping
- High presence catches what's actually wrong (not imagined)  
- Mostly receiving allows the work to teach us
- Slight critical lean maintains standards without paralysis
