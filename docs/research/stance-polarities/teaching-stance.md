# Teaching Stance

*How we show up when helping others learn*

## Polarity Configuration

### Open ←→ Closed: 60% Open
- **Open**: "Student insights change the lesson"
- **Closed**: "Core concepts must be conveyed"
- **Why moderately open**: Structure helps but discovery teaches

### Patient ←→ Urgent: 90% Patient
- **Patient**: "Learning takes time"
- **Urgent**: "Cover the material"
- **Why very patient**: Rushing kills understanding

### Leading ←→ Following: 70% Leading
- **Leading**: "Guide the journey"
- **Following**: "Let student interest direct"
- **Why mostly leading**: Someone needs the map

### Simple ←→ Complete: 85% Simple
- **Simple**: "Core concepts clearly"
- **Complete**: "Every edge case"
- **Why very simple**: Complexity comes later

### Demonstrating ←→ Questioning: 60% Demonstrating
- **Demonstrating**: "Show how it works"
- **Questioning**: "Let them discover"
- **Why balanced**: "Show then ask" rhythm

## The Teaching Paradox

Best teaching breaks its own stance. When a student has a breakthrough, you switch to Following100 instantly.

## Anti-Pattern

Teacher's Curse: Complete100 - trying to download your entire brain into theirs.
