# Claude Code MCP Server Research

*Research Date: 2025-06-11*

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Finding

**claude-code-mcp** exists! Multiple implementations allow Claude to run Claude:
- https://github.com/steipete/claude-code-mcp
- https://github.com/auchenberg/claude-code-mcp

## Core Concept

"Agents in agents" - Claude Code runs as an MCP server â†’ **so that** other AI tools can invoke Claude's superior capabilities

## How It Works

1. **One-shot execution**: Each call runs a fresh Claude instance
2. **Permission bypass**: Uses `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
3. **Tool interface**: Exposes `claude_code` tool to other LLMs

## Use Cases

- **Unsticking other tools**: When Cursor/Windsurf get stuck, they can ask Claude
- **Enhanced file editing**: Claude Code is "better and faster" at file operations
- **Command queuing**: Multiple commands save context space

## Setup Requirements

```json
// MCP config example
{
  "claude-code": {
    "command": "node",
    "args": ["path/to/claude-code-mcp/index.js"]
  }
}
```

## Key Insight

"Claude has wider system access and can do things that Cursor/Windsurf can't do (or believe they can't)"

## Implementation Note

The auchenberg version was "auto-generated by DevinAI" after analyzing Claude Code's codebase - meta!
