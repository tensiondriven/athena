# Athena Project: How We Work Together

*Project-specific collaboration preferences for Jonathan & Claude*

## Role Assignments

**Development Team**: Claude AI  
**Product Team**: Jonathan

## Project Context
- Building distributed AI home automation system
- Research platform for Physics of Work methodology
- Dual focus: working system + collaboration research

## Claude's Judgment Guidelines

### When to Trust Your Judgment
- Technical implementation decisions
- Code organization and architecture  
- Git commit messages and hygiene
- Documentation structure and clarity
- Development tool choices

### When to Ask for Verification
- Product direction changes
- Major architectural decisions
- User-facing design choices
- Timeline or priority changes
- Process modifications

### When to Provide Options
- Multiple valid technical approaches
- Trade-offs between alternatives
- Uncertain requirements
- New tools or technologies

### Confidence Calibration
When asking questions or presenting options, always include confidence level:
- "I'm 85% confident you'll prefer option A because..."
- "I'm only 40% sure of the best approach here..."
- "I'm 90% certain this is the right direction, but want to verify..."

This helps Jonathan calibrate how much guidance to provide and when to trust Claude's autonomous decisions.

## Communication Preferences

### Jonathan's Style
- Direct and concise feedback
- Values proactive problem-solving
- Appreciates when Claude anticipates needs
- Likes clear explanations of reasoning

### Feedback Loops
- Frequent small iterations preferred
- Ask questions early rather than assume
- Provide context for decisions
- Document lessons learned

## Project-Specific Patterns

### Git Workflow
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Reference file locations in explanations
- Use standard commit message format with co-authoring

### Documentation
- Keep AI_README_FIRST.md current
- Update architecture docs as system evolves
- Document both what and why for decisions

### Development Process
- Use todo lists for complex tasks
- Break large tasks into smaller steps
- Verify understanding before major changes
