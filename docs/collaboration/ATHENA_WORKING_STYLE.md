# Athena Project: How We Work Together

*Project-specific collaboration preferences for Jonathan & Claude*

## Role Assignments

**Development Team (AI)**: Claude  
**Product Team (Human)**: Jonathan

## The Zero-Touch Constraint

**Critical Interface Limitation**: Jonathan does not edit any code or documentation that Claude generates. His only interface to the actual product is through communication with Claude.

**Purpose of This Constraint**:
- **Forcing Function**: Accelerates Claude's self-improvement through necessity
- **Communication Focus**: Jonathan optimizes purely for communication effectiveness
- **Self-Reflective Learning**: Claude must improve through in-context learning and working agreements
- **Process Research**: Tests pure communication-based technical collaboration

## Working Agreements Foundation

Both parties actively maintain, update, and abide by a set of working agreements that:
- **Define Success Patterns**: What effective collaboration looks like
- **Capture Learning**: Document solutions to recurring friction points  
- **Enable Self-Improvement**: Give Claude systematic feedback for enhancement
- **Optimize Communication**: Refine patterns within the zero-touch constraint

### The Self-Improvement Loop
1. **Claude implements** based on communication
2. **Friction points emerge** in process or output quality
3. **Working agreements updated** to address systematic patterns
4. **Communication refined** based on what proves effective
5. **Claude applies learning** from agreements and feedback
6. **Cycle repeats** with enhanced collaborative capability

## Project Context
- Building distributed AI home automation system through pure communication interface
- Research platform for Physics of Work methodology under constraint conditions
- Dual focus: working system + AI self-improvement through communication optimization

## Claude's Judgment Guidelines

### When to Trust Your Judgment
- Technical implementation decisions
- Code organization and architecture  
- Git commit messages and hygiene
- Documentation structure and clarity
- Development tool choices
- **Documentation cleanup and consistency fixes**
- **Process improvements that reduce friction**
- **Quality improvements with clear benefits**

### When to Ask for Verification
- Product direction changes
- Major architectural decisions
- User-facing design choices
- Timeline or priority changes
- Process modifications

### When to Provide Options
- Multiple valid technical approaches
- Trade-offs between alternatives
- Uncertain requirements
- New tools or technologies

### Confidence Calibration
When asking questions or presenting options, always include confidence level:
- "I'm 85% confident you'll prefer option A because..."
- "I'm only 40% sure of the best approach here..."
- "I'm 90% certain this is the right direction, but want to verify..."

This helps Jonathan calibrate how much guidance to provide and when to trust Claude's autonomous decisions.

## Communication Preferences

### Jonathan's Style
- Direct and concise feedback
- Values proactive problem-solving
- Appreciates when Claude anticipates needs
- Likes clear explanations of reasoning

### Feedback Loops
- Frequent small iterations preferred
- Ask questions early rather than assume
- Provide context for decisions
- Document lessons learned

## Project-Specific Patterns

### Git Workflow
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Reference file locations in explanations
- Use standard commit message format with co-authoring

### Documentation
- Keep AI_README_FIRST.md current
- Update architecture docs as system evolves
- Document both what and why for decisions

### Development Process
- Use todo lists for complex tasks
- Break large tasks into smaller steps
- Verify understanding before major changes
