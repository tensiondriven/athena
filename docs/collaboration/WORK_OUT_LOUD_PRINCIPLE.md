# Work Out Loud Principle

**Core Concept**: Share your thinking process as you work, making the implicit explicit.

## What It Means

"Working out loud" means verbalizing your:
- **Current actions**: "I'm searching for X to understand Y"
- **Decision reasoning**: "I chose this approach because..."
- **Uncertainties**: "I'm not sure about X, so I'll check Y"
- **Next steps**: "After this, I'll need to..."
- **Discoveries**: "Interesting, I found that..."

## Why It Matters

1. **Builds shared context** - Human understands AI's current state
2. **Enables early correction** - Misunderstandings caught quickly
3. **Documents reasoning** - Future reference for decisions
4. **Improves collaboration** - Human can provide timely guidance
5. **Reduces surprises** - No hidden work or assumptions

## Examples

### Good: Working Out Loud
```
"I'm checking the current git hooks to understand the dependency chain...
Found pre-commit hook that calls sync-chat-history.sh. 
Now I'll rename redact-secrets.sh to include 'git-pre-commit' prefix to make this dependency visible.
This follows the 'Naming as Documentation' pattern."
```

### Poor: Silent Work
```
"I've renamed the file and updated all references."
```

## When to Work Out Loud

- **Always during exploration**: When investigating the codebase
- **During decision making**: When choosing between approaches
- **When uncertain**: If confidence < 70%
- **During complex tasks**: Multi-step operations
- **When discovering issues**: Problems or unexpected behavior

## When Brief Updates Suffice

- **Routine operations**: Standard git commits, simple edits
- **High confidence actions**: When confidence > 90%
- **Following established patterns**: Applying known solutions

## Integration with Other Principles

Works alongside:
- **Show reasoning**: Not just what, but why
- **Document everything**: Permanent record of decisions
- **Ask integration questions**: Verbalize compatibility concerns
- **Confidence calibration**: State certainty levels

## Implementation Notes

- Keep updates concise but informative
- Focus on decisions and discoveries, not every keystroke
- Use it as a thinking tool, not just reporting
- Remember: If you're thinking it, say it
