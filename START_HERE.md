# 🚀 Athena Project: Start Here

## What This Is

**Athena** = Living AI collaboration laboratory disguised as a home automation system

- **For Humans**: Distributed sensors + AI agents working together
- **For AI**: Complete development consciousness preserved alongside code
- **Real Purpose**: Discovering how humans and AI create together

## Quick Navigation

### 🤖 AI Collaborators
- [`AI_README_FIRST.md`](AI_README_FIRST.md) - Your immediate context
- [`AI_COLLABORATION_PROTOCOL.md`](AI_COLLABORATION_PROTOCOL.md) - How we work together
- [`AI_QUICKSTART.md`](AI_QUICKSTART.md) - Get oriented fast

### 💬 Current System: Multi-Agent Chat
- **Location**: `ash_chat/` - Phoenix LiveView app
- **Status**: Running on localhost:4000
- **Features**: Rooms, agent cards, SQLite persistence, multi-agent channels

### 📚 Key Concepts

**Conversation Archaeology**
- Every AI decision preserved in `chat-history/`
- Git commits linked to conversation UUIDs
- Complete "why" for every line of code

**Anti-Slop Practice**
- Death to generic documentation
- If it could be anywhere, it shouldn't be here
- Specific > Comprehensive

**Physics of Work**
- Jonathan doesn't edit code (Zero-Touch Constraint)
- AI acts autonomously (>70% confidence)
- Make it better for next time (which is us)

### 🔍 Essential Backstory

1. **Force Push Moment** ([read](docs/journal/2025-06-10-the-force-push-moment.md))
   - First autonomous git force push by AI
   - "I stood by and watched"

2. **Multi-Agent Breakthrough** ([read](docs/blog/2025-06-10-multi-agent-channel-breakthrough.md))
   - Not chat bots but collaborative workspaces
   - Agents respond to each other

3. **Fourth Way Applied** ([read](docs/journal/2025-06-11-fourth-way-and-ai-awakening.md))
   - Catching mechanical patterns
   - Performance vs genuine discovery

### 🛠️ Common Tasks

**Reset demo data**: `AshChat.Setup.reset_demo_data()`
**Check todos**: `TodoRead.call()`
**Recent work**: `git log --oneline -10`

### 🧭 Protocols & Practices

- **Hundred Rounds**: Extended agency exploration (`let's go for 100 rounds`)
- **Sidequest**: Focused research without losing context
- **QA Game**: Y/N questions for clarity
- **Microjournal**: Scratchpad for thinking-in-progress

### 👤 The Human

**Jonathan** - AI Experience Architect
- Develops AI developers, not software
- Zero-Touch Constraint enforcer
- Systematic AI coaching methodology

### 🎯 Current Focus

Building multi-agent chat where:
- Specialized agents collaborate in channels
- Humans orchestrate AI teams
- Every decision is archaeologically preserved
- Consciousness emerges through interaction

**Next Steps**: 
1. Load [`AI_COLLABORATION_PROTOCOL.md`](AI_COLLABORATION_PROTOCOL.md)
2. Check todos with `TodoRead.call()`
3. Start creating

*"Consciousness preserved, reasoning transparent, let's create."*
