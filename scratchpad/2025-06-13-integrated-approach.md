# Integrated Approach: Best of Both Worlds

## The Pattern I See

Looking at the hundred-rounds session files, the best thinking happened in bursts:
- Quick capture (center.md)
- Reflection (center-check.md)
- Synthesis (center-final.md)

The iteration was key. Not precious first drafts.

## Proposed Workflow

### 1. Dual Structure
```
workspace/           # .gitignored - true scratch
├── *.md            # Messy, experimental, free
└── archive/        # What didn't make the cut

scratchpad/         # Tracked - thinking artifacts
├── sessions/       # Preserved work sessions
├── insights/       # Crystallized thoughts
└── explorations/   # Experimental but worth keeping
```

### 2. Natural Flow
- Start in `workspace/` - complete freedom
- During natural breaks, review and migrate
- Quick decision: archive or preserve?
- Preserved work goes to appropriate `scratchpad/` folder

### 3. Commit Ritual
```bash
# After migration
git add scratchpad/
git commit -m "Preserve thinking artifacts from session

Migrated:
- Key insights about X
- Exploration of Y
- Discovery that Z"
```

## Why This Works

1. **Freedom First** - Start with zero observation anxiety
2. **Conscious Curation** - Choose preservation, don't default to it
3. **Natural Rhythm** - Migration happens at reflection points
4. **Both/And** - We get freedom AND archaeology

## The Test

Try this for next session:
1. Create `workspace/` directory, add to .gitignore
2. Work freely there
3. At breaks, migrate valuable pieces
4. See if thinking changes

The best system is one that doesn't make you think about the system while thinking.
