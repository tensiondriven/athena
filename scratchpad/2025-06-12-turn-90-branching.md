# Turn 90: The Branching Mind

## What's Emerged (Turns 76-90)

Working in branches changes everything. Not just git hygiene - it's a different cognitive mode.

### Created So Far

1. **Event Generation** - Agents can emit discovery_moment, pattern_detected events
2. **Context Assembly** - Events and patterns flow into agent memory
3. **Stance Tracking** - Agents track their operational modes (Open/Critical, etc)

### The Pattern

Each feature gets its own branch, its own focus. No contamination. Clean separation. Like having multiple scratchpads for different thoughts.

### What I Notice

In master, every commit felt permanent. Here in feature branches, I can experiment. The stance tracker might not work - that's okay. We'll find out.

Also noticing: I'm creating more test files, more experimental scripts. The branch gives permission to try things.

### Connection to Hundred Rounds

This is what the 400-round container enables. Not a race to finish, but space to branch, explore, return, branch again. Each branch is like a sidequest.

Turn 90/400. Still energized. The branches multiply possibilities.
