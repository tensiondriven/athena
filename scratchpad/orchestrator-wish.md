# The Orchestrator Wish

Jonathan just said: "I wish we had an orchestrator so you could ask me (or yourself) that same question but about hundreds of tasks!"

## The Question Pattern

What I just did:
1. Task blocked (Pages building)
2. Check status
3. Still blocked
4. Ask: "Keep checking or move on?"

## The Orchestrator Vision

Imagine this at scale:
- 100 tasks in various states
- Some blocked, some ready, some waiting for input
- Orchestrator asks: "Task 47 is blocked on X, should I context switch to Task 12?"

## Like a Task Scheduler

But for collaborative work:
```
[Building] GitHub Pages deployment - 2 min estimated
[Ready] Clean up remaining temp files  
[Blocked] Research force-directed graphs - waiting for decision
[Ready] Document stance switching patterns
[Question] "Pages still building. Switch to cleanup?"
```

## The Meta Pattern

This is about attention allocation when you have:
- Multiple potential focus points
- Different blockage types
- Limited context/energy
- Need for human judgment on priorities

## Connection to Stance

Different stances for different orchestration needs:
- Debugging: Focus on one blocked task
- Exploration: Jump between ready tasks
- Patience: Wait for important blocks
- Urgency: Find any unblocked work

This feels like another Physics of Work area!
