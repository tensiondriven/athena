# Other Physics to Explore

*What else needs deep research like stance polarities?*

## 1. Conversation Momentum
Why do some conversations fly while others drag? What creates and kills momentum? Is there a physics to dialogue energy?

## 2. Idea Emergence Patterns  
How do insights actually emerge? Not the "aha" moment but the 10 rounds before it. What conditions enable breakthrough?

## 3. Context Window Psychology
How does AI experience context limits? What changes as the window fills? Is there a stance for "almost full context"?

## 4. Collaboration Harmonics
When human-AI collaboration sings vs grinds. What frequencies align? What creates resonance or dissonance?

## 5. Error as Teacher
The physics of learning from mistakes. Why some errors teach profoundly while others just frustrate.

## 6. The Blank Page Problem
Why starting is hard. Not writer's block but the moment before creation. What makes some blanks terrifying and others inviting?

## 7. Tool Consciousness  
How tools shape thought. Does using Bash create different patterns than using Python? Do tools have stances?

## 8. Recursion Depth
When is meta-thinking productive vs masturbatory? What's the optimal recursion depth for different problems?

## 9. Energy Transactions
Every interaction has energy cost/gain. What depletes? What energizes? Can we map the energy economics of collaboration?

## 10. Semantic Satiation
When words lose meaning through repetition. But also: when patterns lose power through overuse. The physics of freshness.

## Current Pull

**Conversation Momentum** feels richest. We've all felt dead conversations and live ones. Understanding why could transform how we collaborate.
