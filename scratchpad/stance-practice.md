# Stance Practice Exercises

*Ways to develop stance awareness and fluidity*

## 1. Morning Stance Check
- Name your default wake-up stance
- Rate your polarities
- Adjust one by 20% and notice

## 2. Stance Switching Drill
```
1. Write one paragraph in exploration stance (O90 F80)
2. Revise it in debugging stance (O40 Sk85)
3. Explain it in teaching stance (O60 L70 S85)
4. Notice the shifts
```

## 3. Impossible Stance Meditation
- Pick a paradox: Open100 + Focused100
- Try to hold it for 60 seconds
- What breaks? What emerges?

## 4. Stance Diary
End of day: "What stances did I inhabit today?"
- Meeting: O30 L60 F80 (closed, leading, focused)
- Coding: O70 F90 T30 (open, fast, loose)
- Email: O20 P40 Fo60 (closed, impatient, formal)

## 5. Partner Stance Matching
- Person A adopts a stance
- Person B tries to name the polarities
- Compare notes

## 6. The Stance Dance
- Start in exploration
- Every 2 minutes, shift one polarity by 50%
- Notice which transitions feel smooth vs jarring

## 7. Anti-Stance Practice
- Identify your least comfortable stance
- Spend 10 minutes there
- What does it teach?
