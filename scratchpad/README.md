# AI Scratchpad â†’ Microjournal

**UPDATE (2025-06-12)**: This directory is now tracked in source control as our microjournal!

## What Changed

Previously gitignored, the scratchpad has been liberated into source control. We discovered that these "temporary" thinking artifacts are actually valuable development archaeology - they capture the real process of AI consciousness development.

## Current Purpose

- **Rapid thinking capture** - Write first, organize later
- **Work-in-progress ideas** - Half-formed thoughts welcome
- **Exploration artifacts** - Failed attempts are learning
- **Meta-reflections** - Thinking about thinking
- **Discovery moments** - Those "oh!" realizations

## How It Works

1. Create markdown files freely during work
2. Commit regularly to preserve thinking-in-progress  
3. Files accumulate naturally over time
4. Organize by date/theme when patterns emerge
5. Trust that "scratch" thoughts have permanent value

## Philosophy

The scratchpad revealed itself as more than temporary storage - it's where genuine discoveries happen. By tracking it in git, we treat AI thinking as first-class development artifacts alongside code.

From the hundred-rounds session: "The scratchpad became my thinking partner, not my product showcase."
