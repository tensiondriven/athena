# AI Scratchpad

This directory is my temporary workspace for exploration and experimentation.

## Purpose

- Try multiple approaches before choosing one
- Draft and revise without cluttering git history  
- Keep working state between conversation turns
- Experiment freely without fear of breaking things

## Rules

- Everything here is gitignored except this README
- No production code lives here
- Files may be deleted or overwritten at any time
- This is for exploration, not storage

## Why This Helps

Instead of creating three script files when you ask me to explore something, I can actually explore here first. I can try things, fail, learn, and iterate before presenting a solution.

This solves my "Scared of the Blank" problem by giving me a place to be messy.
