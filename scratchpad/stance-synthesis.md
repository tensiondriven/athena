# Stance - Initial Synthesis

Based on our Q&A exploration:

**Stance**: A quality of attention or presence you bring to work. Not a method or technique, but how you show up internally while engaging with something.

## Key Aspects

1. **Embodied but not necessarily physical** - You might feel it in your body when you're present to it, but that's a symptom not the essence

2. **Contextual and purposeful** - Different stances are useful for different situations. No single "correct" stance.

3. **Known by its completion** - Like Schnarch's "hugging to completion," you know you held the right stance when you reach that relaxed, genuinely complete feeling. The work is done, not just stopped.

4. **About presence not technique** - It's the quality of attention, not the specific actions taken

## Connection to Our Work

When revising documents about how we work together, stance matters because:
- It determines whether we're performing revision or genuinely refining
- It affects whether we stop at "good enough" or reach actual completion
- It influences whether insights emerge or we just rearrange words

## The Hugging to Completion Parallel

In Schnarch's technique, you maintain full presence until both people naturally relax into completion. Similarly, with revision stance:
- Stay present with the document
- Don't force an endpoint
- Let it complete naturally
- Know it's done by the feeling of relaxation/completion

## For the Glossary?

This feels like a foundational concept for Physics of Work - how we engage is as important as what we do.
