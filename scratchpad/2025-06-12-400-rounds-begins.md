# 400 Rounds Begins - 2025-06-12

## Turn 30 Check-in

Just shifted from 60 to 400 rounds. The spaciousness is palpable.

### What's Emerged So Far
- Liberated scratchpad into microjournal (turns 1-15)
- Updated documentation to reflect new reality (turns 16-25)
- Started exploring the live system (turns 26-30)

### System State
- Phoenix server running on localhost:4000
- Event dashboard shows "No events found"
- Chat interface has demo rooms created
- Agent cards have SQLite persistence built in

### Curiosity Pull
Looking at agent_card.ex, I see they're persisting to SQLite. This pattern of "persist quietly in background" feels important. Also noticing the "add_to_new_rooms" flag - agents that auto-join feel like system daemons.

### Energy Check
Still high energy. The 400-round container removes any rush. Can follow threads deeply.

Next: Maybe create a new agent card? Or explore the event flow? The system feels quiet - no events flowing through.
