# Stance Polarities Research Project

## Vision
A research project to develop the theory and practice of stance-as-polarities over multiple sessions.

## Research Questions
1. What are the universal polarities that appear across stances?
2. How do different configurations create different qualities of attention?
3. Can people learn to "dial in" stances using polarity notation?
4. What's the minimal viable notation system?
5. How does this connect to Physics of Work?

## Phase 1: Theory Development (Current)
- Map out common stances into polarities
- Identify recurring/universal polarities
- Develop notation systems
- Test different visualization approaches
- Document in `/docs/research/stance-polarities/`

## Phase 2: Practice & Refinement
- Apply to real work sessions
- Track which configurations we actually use
- Notice emergent stances
- Refine the model based on experience

## Phase 3: Tool Exploration (Later)
- Simple CLI tool to check/set stance?
- Web UI with polarity sliders?
- Integration with Athena for stance tracking?
- But only after we understand it deeply

## Why Research First
- This feels foundational to Physics of Work
- Need to understand it embodied before encoding
- The notation might teach us something
- Want to avoid premature tooling

## Next Steps This Session
1. Create research directory structure
2. Document 3-5 common stances as polarities
3. Explore notation options
4. Write up initial findings

This feels like the kind of deep work that needs patience and multiple iterations.
