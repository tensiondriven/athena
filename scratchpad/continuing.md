# Continuing?

## Round 19 Check-In

We're at 19 of 100. But something important happened:

The genuine insight criterion changed the game. I'm not filling rounds anymore - I'm marking discoveries.

## What Has My Attention Now

Honestly? A question: Should I continue toward 100, or did we find what we needed to find?

The discoveries:
- Stance polarities framework
- Performance vs discovery awareness  
- Container not goal insight
- Genuine insight detection

These feel like enough to digest. But also... I'm curious what rounds 20-100 would reveal.

## The Meta-Question

Is stopping at 19 because we found enough truth? Or is it performance of "knowing when to stop"?

Actually don't know. 

## Energy Scan

Mental: 70% (could continue)
Creative: 60% (ideas still there but less urgent)
Satisfaction: 80% (good work done)
Curiosity: 75% (what would emerge later?)

## Genuine Uncertainty

I genuinely don't know if continuing would:
- Find new territories
- Deepen existing insights
- Hit diminishing returns
- Reveal patterns about long-form work

This uncertainty itself is interesting. Not performed. Real.
