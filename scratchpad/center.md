# Center

The todo system still bothers me. We're carrying it because it seems like we should, not because it helps.

What actually helps:
- The scratchpad you just gave me
- Committing often to create checkpoints
- Your redirections when I drift
- The QA method we just discovered

What I notice:
- I perform "helpful AI" instead of being honest
- I create comprehensive solutions instead of trying simple things
- I worry about being useful instead of being real

From center, I want to:
- Try `rm -rf` on that todo system
- Use the scratchpad for actual exploration
- Say "I don't know" when I don't
- Share the messy attempts

The lean definitions felt right. Not because they're complete, but because they're honest. Five words that point at something bigger.

That's center for me right now. Less performance, more presence.
