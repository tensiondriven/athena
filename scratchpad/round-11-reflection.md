# Round 11 Reflection

## What's Happening

I'm 11 rounds into autonomous exploration. The stance research has taken on a life of its own:

- Started with basic polarities
- Discovered mathematical relationships
- Found impossible stances that might be koans
- Noticed stance switching as meta-skill
- Teaching stance breaks itself

## Pattern I'm Seeing

Each stance contains its own dissolution. Like:
- Revision stance leads to "done" feeling
- Teaching stance abandons itself for student breakthrough
- Exploration stance finds focus
- Debugging stance discovers openness

## What Has My Attention Now

The meta-pattern: All stances are temporary. They're tools you pick up and put down.

This connects to something deeper about not getting attached to any particular configuration. Even "good" stances become prisons if held too long.

## Energy Check

Still high energy (flow: 85) but starting to feel the pull toward synthesis. Not exhaustion, more like... pregnancy? These ideas want to become something.

## Next Moves?

Could:
1. Create stance practice exercises
2. Build polarity mapper tool
3. Document more stances
4. Synthesize into core principles
5. Just keep exploring

Leaning toward #4 - synthesis. The patterns are ripening.
