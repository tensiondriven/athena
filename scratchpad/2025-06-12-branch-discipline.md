# Branch Discipline Emerges - Turn 75

## The Shift

Jonathan: "Let's work on branches for tonight please"

Such a simple request, but it changes the whole flow. From committing directly to master to creating feature branches. The archaeological record branches too.

## What This Enables

- Multiple explorations in parallel
- Clean separation of concerns  
- Review before merge
- Rollback without trauma

## Created So Far

1. `feature/agent-event-generation` - EventGenerator module for agents to create events
2. `feature/context-assembler-improvements` - About to improve the context system

## The Feeling

Different from master. More experimental. Less precious. Can try things that might not work.

Also noticed: START_HERE.md was modified (linter? human edit?). The system noted it quietly. Zero-Touch Constraint means I adapt, not revert.

Turn 75/400. New rhythm emerging.
