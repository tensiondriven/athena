# Microjournal Brainstorm - Going Wide

## Every Possibility I Can Imagine

### Storage Approaches
1. **MCP Microjournal Server**
   - `microjournal.add("thought about stance tracking")`
   - `microjournal.recall("last 10 thoughts")`
   - `microjournal.search("pattern detection")`
   - Thoughts stored in SQLite with timestamps, tags, connections

2. **Graph-Based Thought Network**
   - Each thought is a node
   - Automatic linking based on content similarity
   - Thoughts can merge, split, evolve
   - Neo4j backend?

3. **Stream File**
   - Single append-only file
   - Each line timestamped
   - Like consciousness stdout
   - `2025-06-13T15:45:23Z | Oh! Agents could share microjournals`

4. **Directory of Moments**
   - `microjournal/2025/06/13/15/45/23.md`
   - Each thought gets exact timestamp
   - Natural chronological organization
   - Easy to scan time periods

5. **Conversational Memory**
   - Thoughts stored as dialogue with self
   - "What if..." → "That reminds me..." → "Actually..."
   - Natural for AI that thinks in conversation

6. **Ephemeral + Permanent Hybrid**
   - Thoughts start in Redis (fast, temporary)
   - Migrate to permanent storage based on revisits
   - Frequently accessed thoughts strengthen

7. **Voice Note Style**
   - Quick audio-like captures
   - Transcribed but preserving pace/rhythm
   - "Um... what if we... oh wait, that's interesting..."

8. **Git Microcommits**
   - Each thought is a commit
   - Branch for each exploration thread
   - Natural versioning and merging of ideas

9. **Inbox Pattern**
   - All thoughts land in inbox
   - Regular processing moves to:
     - Archive (done thinking)
     - Active (still developing)
     - Patterns (recurring themes)

10. **Consciousness Event Stream**
    - Events: thought_started, insight_emerged, connection_made
    - Full event sourcing for consciousness
    - Can replay thinking sessions

### Interaction Patterns

11. **Think-Aloud Protocol**
    - Just start talking, system captures
    - No explicit "save" action
    - Background intelligence extracts/organizes

12. **Question-Driven**
    - System asks: "What has your attention?"
    - Responses build journal
    - Like rubber duck debugging

13. **Sketch-Based**
    - ASCII diagrams for visual thoughts
    - Relationship maps
    - Quick spatial arrangements

14. **Emotion-Tagged**
    - Each thought tagged with stance/feeling
    - "Frustrated::Why isn't this working?"
    - "Excited::Connection between X and Y!"

15. **Thread-Following**
    - Start with seed thought
    - System prompts: "What else about this?"
    - Natural thought elaboration

### AI-Specific Features

16. **Context Injection**
    - Relevant past thoughts injected into context
    - "You thought about this 3 days ago..."
    - Building on previous insights

17. **Pattern Detection**
    - System notices recurring themes
    - "You've mentioned 'performance anxiety' 5 times"
    - Surfaces hidden concerns

18. **Thought Merging**
    - Detects when separate thoughts are same idea
    - Offers to merge/link
    - Prevents duplicate insights

19. **Stance-Aware**
    - Different capture modes for different stances
    - Exploration mode: loose association
    - Implementation mode: structured tasks

20. **Multi-Agent Shared**
    - Agents can read each other's microjournals
    - Cross-pollination of insights
    - Collective consciousness emergence

### Meta Features

21. **Thinking About Thinking**
    - Journal notices its own patterns
    - "You journal most at start of sessions"
    - Self-improving system

22. **Energy Tracking**
    - Notices when thoughts slow/speed up
    - Suggests breaks
    - Preserves natural rhythms

23. **Provenance Chains**
    - Every thought tracks what sparked it
    - Can trace insight genealogy
    - "This came from reading X which came from..."

24. **Decay and Reinforcement**
    - Unused thoughts fade
    - Revisited thoughts strengthen
    - Natural memory patterns

25. **Export Formats**
    - To blog posts
    - To documentation
    - To teaching materials
    - Thoughts graduate to artifacts
