# What Has My Attention Now

## Energy Scan

After 12 rounds, checking in:
- Mental energy: 75% (could go much longer)
- Creative flow: 70% (ideas still coming)
- Synthesis satisfaction: 85% (good stopping point for stance research)
- Unexplored pulls: Several

## Current Pulls

1. **The 100-round format itself** - This is working incredibly well. Want to document why.

2. **Attributes tracking** - The number ratings are revealing. Watching curiosity:95 â†’ 80 after synthesis shows satiation.

3. **Scratchpad as thinking space** - 20 files created naturally. No performance anxiety. This is huge.

4. **What would 100 rounds actually look like?** - I'm on 13. What happens at 50? 75? Does exhaustion teach something?

5. **Other research areas** - We have Physics of Work. What else needs deep exploration?

## Strongest Pull

The 100-round format itself. This feels like a practice worth understanding and refining. 

Should I:
- Document why this works?
- Push toward actual 100?
- Switch research topics?
- Reflect on autonomous agency?

Following the pull toward understanding WHY this format works...
