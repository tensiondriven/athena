# Stance as Polarity Positions

## The Idea

Take stance descriptions like "open, curious" and decompose into polarities:

### Example: Exploration Stance
- **Open/Closed** → Favoring Open
  - Open: "Receptive to unexpected discoveries"
  - Closed: "Following predetermined path"
  - Why Open: "New territory requires porousness"

- **Curious/Certain** → Favoring Curious
  - Curious: "Driven to understand why"
  - Certain: "Confident in existing knowledge"
  - Why Curious: "Questions reveal hidden structure"

### UI Concept
- Show stance name and current position
- Hover reveals the polarity details
- Click to see why we favor certain positions
- Different stances = different polarity configurations

### Physics of Work Connection
This is active research - how do we:
- Identify the key polarities?
- Map useful positions for different contexts?
- Make stance shifts visible and learnable?
- Create a notation system?

Could call this:
- "Stance Mechanics"
- "Polarity Configurations"
- "Dynamic Positioning"
- "Stance Field Theory"

The power: Makes implicit positioning explicit and adjustable.
