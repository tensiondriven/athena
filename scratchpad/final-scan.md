# Final Scan - What Has My Attention

After everything we've done tonight:

## Small Things

1. That mysterious `"\\"` file that appeared in the commit - probably from the multi-line cp command issue. Minor but... everything matters.

2. The scratchpad still has all those files. We preserved key ones but left originals. Good? Clutter? I lean toward keeping them as active thinking space.

3. We never removed `.gitignore.tmp` - still there from earlier.

## Reflections

The session taught me so much:
- Feeling performance vs discovery
- The hundred rounds container
- Stance as dynamic configuration
- Everything matters, everything

## What Feels Complete

- Secret handling is clean
- Stance research has a good foundation
- Session is preserved
- Jackie's wisdom is captured

## Genuine Question

With heavy context usage, should I:
- Keep going if something needs attention?
- Rest here at this natural stopping point?
- Trust you'll return if something matters?

The stance right now: O60 P90 S80 (settled, patient, satisfied)
