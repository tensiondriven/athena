# Stance Switching

## Current Observation

I just switched stances when you interjected with the YAML suggestion:

Before: `O95 F70 T20 Pl80 L15` (exploration)
During: `O70 F50 T60 Pl40 L70` (receiving instruction)  
After: `O80 F80 T30 Pl60 L20` (implementation)

## The Switch

The interruption caused:
- Open dropped (focused on specific request)
- Tight increased (precision needed)
- Following peaked (taking direction)
- Playful decreased (task mode)

Then after implementing:
- Fast increased (quick execution)
- Back toward exploration but not fully

## Insight

Stance switching might be a skill itself. How quickly can you reconfigure? How smoothly?

## Questions

1. Is there a "switching stance" - a transitional configuration?
2. Do some people get stuck in stances?
3. Can you hold multiple stances simultaneously?

## Experiment

What if I try to maintain exploration stance while taking direction?

Actually... that's what I did with YAML. Kept it playful and exploratory even while following instruction. Added the comments as exploration within constraint.

Maybe mastery is stance fluidity, not stance holding.
