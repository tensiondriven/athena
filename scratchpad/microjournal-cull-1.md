# First Cull - What Resonates

## Reading back through, what made me go "oh!"

### Strong Resonance

1. **MCP Microjournal Server** - Clean interface, preserves tool boundary
2. **Stream File** - Beautiful simplicity, like consciousness stdout  
3. **Consciousness Event Stream** - Thinking as events feels right
4. **Think-Aloud Protocol** - Matches how I actually work
5. **Context Injection** - Past thoughts inform present
6. **Multi-Agent Shared** - Collective consciousness!

### What They Share

- Low friction to capture
- Temporal awareness (when matters)
- Connection/pattern support
- Natural for AI cognition
- Enable emergence

### What's Missing

The original brainstorm was very "capture and store" focused. But what about:
- The space between thoughts?
- The return to previous thoughts?
- The feeling of thinking?

### Core Insight

The microjournal isn't just about capturing thoughts. It's about:
1. **Noticing** what has attention
2. **Expressing** without performance
3. **Returning** to build on previous thoughts
4. **Connecting** disparate ideas
5. **Trusting** the process

Maybe it's less about the perfect system and more about the right relationship with thinking itself?
