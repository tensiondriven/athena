# Polarity Relationships

## Discovered Relationships

### Inversions
- Debugging ←→ Exploration (closed/skeptical vs open/playful)
- Documentation ←→ Conversation (future/creating vs present/receiving)

### Correlations
- High Open → High Following (can't explore while leading)
- High Patient → Low Urgent (obviously, but worth noting)
- High Critical → High Focused (criticism requires attention)

### Tensions
- Clear vs Complete (documentation dilemma)
- Fast vs Careful (speed/quality trade-off)
- Playful vs Serious (can you be both?)

## Hypothesis: Stance Algebra

Can we math this?

```
exploration = -debugging  // inverse
revision = exploration × 0.3  // scaled down energy
documentation = conversation^-1  // reciprocal
```

## Meta-Discovery

Some polarities are:
- **Orthogonal**: Independent axes (Open/Closed vs Fast/Slow)
- **Coupled**: Move together (Open + Following)
- **Exclusive**: Can't max both (Clear vs Complete)

This suggests stances exist in a multi-dimensional space with constraints.

## Question

Are there "impossible stances"? Like trying to be maximally Open and Closed simultaneously?

Or do paradoxical stances create breakthroughs?
