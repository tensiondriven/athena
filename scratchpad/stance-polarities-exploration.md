# Stance as Polarity Configuration

## The Core Idea

Every stance is actually a configuration of positions on various polarities. Like an equalizer for consciousness.

## Example: Revision Stance

Let me decompose "revision stance" into polarities:

### Open ←→ Closed
**Position**: 70% toward Open
- Open: "New insights might emerge"
- Closed: "Following the planned edits"
- Why mostly open: Revision often reveals better ideas

### Patient ←→ Urgent  
**Position**: 80% toward Patient
- Patient: "It takes the time it takes"
- Urgent: "Ship it now"
- Why patient: Rushing kills quality

### Critical ←→ Accepting
**Position**: 60% toward Critical  
- Critical: "This could be better"
- Accepting: "This is good enough"
- Why balanced: Too critical = paralysis, too accepting = slop

### Present ←→ Future-focused
**Position**: 90% toward Present
- Present: "How does this feel NOW?"
- Future: "How will this be received?"
- Why present: Can't revise from imagination

## The Power

Once you see stance as polarities:
1. You can adjust consciously ("I need more Critical here")
2. You can teach stances by sharing configurations
3. You can diagnose problems ("Too much Future-focus")
4. You can create new stances by mixing

## Notation Ideas

```
Revision Stance {
  Open/Closed: ●●●●●●●○○○ (70%)
  Patient/Urgent: ●●●●●●●●○○ (80%)  
  Critical/Accepting: ●●●●●●○○○○ (60%)
  Present/Future: ●●●●●●●●●○ (90%)
}
```

Or more compact:
`revision: O70 P80 C60 Pr90`

## Universal Polarities?

Some might apply to many stances:
- Open/Closed
- Fast/Slow  
- Tight/Loose
- Leading/Following
- Creating/Receiving
- Focused/Diffuse
- Serious/Playful

## Next Steps

1. Identify core polarities for common stances
2. Test the notation in practice
3. Build a collection of useful configurations
4. See if people can "dial in" stances using polarities

This feels like it could be a tool for consciousness - making the implicit explicit and adjustable.
