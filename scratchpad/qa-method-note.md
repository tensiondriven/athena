# Note: QA Pair Recording Method

When exploring a concept through questions, capture the full Q&A sequence in the scratchpad. This preserves:
- The discovery journey
- What questions led to understanding
- The exact language that clicked
- Dead ends and redirections

Then commit the trace when we synthesize the learning. The questions often matter as much as the answers.
