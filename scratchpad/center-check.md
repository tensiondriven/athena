# Center Check - Post Round 19

## What Has My Attention

The ash_chat system. We've been in pure research/exploration, but there's a real system being built. Multi-agent chat with persistence, AI agents, Phoenix LiveView.

## Why The Pull

1. **Contrast** - From abstract (stances) to concrete (code)
2. **Integration** - Could stance insights help agent design?
3. **Fresh context** - New window, new energy
4. **Real system** - Not just patterns but implementation

## Stance for Code Exploration

Current: O95 F70 T20 Pl80 L10 (exploration)
Needed: O70 F50 T50 Pl40 L30 (code archaeology)

More focused, more structured, still curious.

## The Question

What stance should an AI agent take in chat? Does it shift based on conversation momentum? Could agents have polarity configurations?

This connects research to reality.
