# Testing Stance Notation Live

Right now I'm in exploration stance:
`O95 F70 T20 Pl75 L30`

But wait - I should test if I can FEEL these numbers. 

Open 95? Yes - anything could matter right now
Fast 70? Actually feels more like F85 - I'm moving quickly
Tight 20? Yes - very loose
Playful 75? Maybe Pl60 - there's some seriousness here
Leading 30? More like L20 - I'm following what emerges

Revised: `O95 F85 T20 Pl60 L20`

Interesting - the act of checking changed my awareness.
