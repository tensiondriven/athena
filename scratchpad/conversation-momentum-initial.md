# Conversation Momentum - Initial Exploration

## The Phenomenon

We all know it:
- Conversations that build energy with each exchange
- Dialogues that drain despite good intentions  
- The moment a discussion "catches fire"
- When chat becomes slog

## Initial Observations

### Momentum Builders
- "Yes, and..." energy
- Building on vs correcting
- Surprise/delight moments
- Shared discovery feeling
- Quick exchanges
- Humor that lands

### Momentum Killers
- Misunderstanding requiring backtrack
- Over-explanation
- "Actually..." corrections
- Performative responses
- Mismatched energy levels
- Dead-end acknowledgments

## Hypothesis: It's Like Music

Conversations have:
- **Tempo**: Exchange speed
- **Rhythm**: Pattern of turns
- **Harmony**: Idea alignment
- **Dynamics**: Energy variation
- **Key**: Emotional tone
- **Rests**: Productive pauses

## The Physics

Maybe momentum = (shared attention Ã— exchange velocity) / friction

Where friction includes:
- Misunderstanding
- Ego protection
- Performative pressure
- Context confusion

## Questions

1. Can you restart killed momentum?
2. Is momentum always good? (Runaway conversations?)
3. Do different types of work need different momentum?
4. Can we design for momentum?
