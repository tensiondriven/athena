# Napkin Log

*Quick captures of what happened - one-liners only*

- Started stance polarities research after it "had my attention"
- Cleared todo list - theater → relief
- Created scratchpad workspace - finally a place to be messy
- QA method discovered - capture the journey not just answer
- "No notes!" - just ship it
- Created 3 stance docs in research dir - theory → examples
- Debugging is inverse of exploration (closed vs open)
- Notation experiments: visual/compact/tagged
- Anti-glossary: words that die when defined
- Notation needs stance too (precision vs looseness)
- CLAUDE.md paradox: rules enable meaningful rule-breaking
- Documentation stance: clarity > completeness
- Stance algebra: stances have mathematical relationships
- Impossible stances might be koans/breakthrough points
- YAML skill tree: cleaner for hierarchical + comments
- Stance switching is a skill - fluidity > holding
- Teaching stance paradox: breaks itself for breakthroughs
- All stances self-dissolve (contain their ending)
- Synthesis stance: balanced, less extreme than exploration
- Created 20+ files in scratchpad - true workspace
- Practice exercises: morning check, switching drill, diary
- Genuine insight: observation changes stance
- Todo theater → relief (visceral discovery)
- Impossible stances work (Open100/Critical100)
- 100 rounds = container not goal (spaciousness)
- Momentum = generative safety (NEW insight)
- Can feel performance vs discovery now
- Context limit reminder → pause & switch focus
- Moving from stance research to ash_chat code
- Question: What stance should AI agents take?
