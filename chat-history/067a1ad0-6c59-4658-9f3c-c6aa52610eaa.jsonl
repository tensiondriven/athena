It goes something like this: Use a layout with a centered fixed with box. in the box, make a list of items. it should be a nested list, 2 levels deep. it represets Projects and Tasks. Maybe 3-5 of each, your choice. Have edge cases in the test data.  What i want is to be able to see an animation where the tasks and projects switch places, and in this case, we would see the project get duplicated under each task.  Please ask me quesitons now, and build up a README.md.   Also copy these notes into a CLAUDE.md or make note of anything you think would be useful to you as we work"},"uuid":"3465d79d-ee63-48f8-8f76-e640a5d7ceb2","timestamp":"2025-05-15T00:58:15.709Z"}
