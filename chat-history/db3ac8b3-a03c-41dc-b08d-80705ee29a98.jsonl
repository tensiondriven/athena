The conversation is summarized below:\nAnalysis:\nThis conversation centers around fixing a git hooks issue where secrets (particularly API keys) were preventing GitHub pushes due to push protection. The user's main request was to fix the gitleaks hook issue and explore better approaches for secret redaction in conversation logs.\n\nThe conversation has several key phases:\n1. Initial problem diagnosis - understanding that secrets were getting into chat logs that are synced to source control\n2. Improving the redaction script to catch more secret patterns (especially OpenRouter and Anthropic keys)\n3. Discovering a critical insight: the pre-commit hook COPIES files from Claude's directory, overwriting local changes\n4. Creating a more robust sync system with integrated redaction\n5. Adding broader development principles (Work Out Loud, thoughtful tool selection)\n6. Attempting to push changes but being blocked by GitHub due to historical secrets\n7. Setting up auto-push reminders in post-commit hooks\n8. Finally attempting to clean git history with git-filter-repo\n\nKey user feedback includes:\n- \"Some secrets got into our chat logs, which are copied into source control before each commit/push. The script isnt catchig all the keys though\"\n- \"That sequence will be in the file because this conversation is the source for it, and its important to maintain it\" (about false positives)\n- \"Can we move the redaction code into that script, so that script will run the redaction script itself and fail and make it super clear where the failure is?\"\n- \"Can you use a tool to pull off #2, and then force push? Or rather, check out a branch and do this, then push it and make sure gihub's filtering passes\"\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   - Fix the gitleaks hook issue to prevent secrets from blocking deployments\n   - Move redaction to pre-commit or add hook, or copy logs as they're edited with validation\n   - Improve secret redaction to catch OpenRouter API keys that were slipping through\n   - Add file size and age information for problematic files\n   - Create a rule for thoughtful tool selection before using shell commands\n   - Add Work Out Loud principle to collaboration agreements\n   - Ensure all files end with newlines (Unix standard)\n   - Clean git history to remove historical secrets blocking push to GitHub\n   - Update post-commit hook to remind about pushing (not auto-push)\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - Git pre-commit hooks that sync files from `~/.claude/projects/` to `chat-history/`\n   - Secret redaction using sed patterns\n   - Gitleaks for secret detection\n   - Git filters (clean/smudge) for automatic file processing\n   - Dependency discovery patterns (naming files to reveal their purpose)\n   - Work Out Loud principle (sharing thinking process while working)\n   - Git history rewriting with git-filter-repo\n   - GitHub push protection blocking pushes containing secrets\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n   - `/Users/j/Code/athena/scripts/redact-secrets.sh` → `/Users/j/Code/athena/scripts/git-pre-commit-redact-secrets.sh`\n      - Renamed to indicate git hook dependency\n      - Added patterns for OpenRouter (`sk-or-v1-*`), Anthropic (`sk-ant-*`), Phoenix session tokens (`SFMyNTY.*`)\n      ```bash\n      sed -E \\\n        -e 's/sk-or-v1-[A-Za-z0-9]+/REDACTED_OPENROUTER_KEY/g' \\\n        -e 's/sk-ant-[A-Za-z0-9_-]+/REDACTED_ANTHROPIC_KEY/g' \\\n        -e 's/SFMyNTY\\.[A-Za-z0-9\\._-]+/REDACTED_PHOENIX_SESSION/g' \\\n      ```\n\n   - `/Users/j/Code/athena/scripts/sync-chat-history.sh`\n      - Integrated redaction directly into sync process\n      - Added gitleaks detection with detailed error reporting\n      ```bash\n      if gitleaks detect --no-git -s \"$dest.tmp\" 2>&1 | grep -q \"leaks found\"; then\n          echo \"  ⚠️  Gitleaks detected secrets in: $filename\"\n          echo \"     File size: $file_size, Last modified: $file_date\"\n      ```\n\n   - `/Users/j/Code/athena/scripts/sync-chat-history-v2.sh`\n      - Simpler version that warns but doesn't fail\n      - More pragmatic for development workflow\n\n   - `/Users/j/Code/athena/.git/hooks/pre-commit`\n      - Updated to use v2 sync script preferentially\n      - Runs gitleaks after sync to validate staged files\n\n   - `/Users/j/Code/athena/.git/hooks/post-commit`\n      - Originally updated to auto-push, then simplified to just show reminder\n      ```bash\n      echo \"📌 Remember: Push immediately to share progress (git push origin $(git branch --show-current))\"\n      ```\n\n   - `/Users/j/Code/athena/docs/blog/2025-06-11-dependency-discovery-patterns.md`\n      - Created to explore 5 rules for making hidden dependencies visible\n      - Naming as Documentation, Dependency Chain, Inverse Manifest, Co-location, Discoverable Documentation\n\n   - `/Users/j/Code/athena/docs/collaboration/WORK_OUT_LOUD_PRINCIPLE.md`\n      - Comprehensive guide on sharing thinking process while working\n\n   - `/Users/j/Code/athena/AI_COLLABORATION_PROTOCOL.md`\n      - Added \"Work out loud\" and \"Consider carefully\" tool selection principles\n      - Updated to note \"Push immediately: Share progress after every commit\"\n\n   - `/Users/j/Code/athena/docs/AI_DEVELOPER_GUIDELINES.md`\n      - Added thoughtful tool selection section with examples\n      - Added file formatting standards (always end with newline)\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n   - **GitHub push protection blocking due to secrets**:\n     - Initially thought redaction was working but keys were still getting through\n     - User insight: \"The hook COPIES files into our local, any changes we make to those specific log files will be lost\"\n     - Fixed by moving redaction into the sync process itself\n   \n   - **False positives in secret detection**:\n     - Gitleaks was finding regex patterns from our conversation about creating redaction\n     - User feedback: \"That sequence will be in the file because this conversation is the source for it\"\n     - Created smarter detection looking for actual secrets, not patterns\n   \n   - **Anthropic API keys in git history**:\n     - Push still blocked after fixing redaction due to historical commits\n     - Attempted to clean with git-filter-repo on a separate branch\n   \n   - **Missing newlines at end of files**:\n     - Fixed 23 files to follow Unix convention\n     - Added guideline to AI Developer Guidelines\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - Identified that pre-commit sync overwrites local changes, requiring redaction during sync\n   - Created comprehensive redaction patterns for multiple API key types\n   - Developed two sync approaches: strict (v1) and pragmatic (v2)\n   - Established principle of making dependencies discoverable through naming\n   - Cleaned git history using git-filter-repo to remove historical secrets\n\n6. All user messages:\n   - \"read the markdown files, acknowldege, and then let's fix this git leaks hookk issue. i think we should move it to pre-commit or even an add hook if it exists.. Or, we could copy the log files in as theyre edited and then have the hook do git leaks validation... you decide\"\n   - \"You can remove that, but that's not the one. It was recenbtly added, its the Openrouter one\"\n   - \"Mother Eff\"\n   - \"So, I think the hook (pre commit, i think, not pre-push) is runs a script which COPYS the files into our local, and as a result, any changes we make to those specific log files will be lost when we commit. Does that make sense?\"\n   - \"Can we move the redaction code into that script, so that script will run the redaction script itself and fail and make it super clear where the failure is? Also include the file size and age of the file that has problems\"\n   - \"That sequence will be in the file because this conversation is the source for it, and its important to maintain it\"\n   - \"You can also try sed on the cli to test it\"\n   - \"The key starts with 'sk-or-v1-'\"\n   - \"[Request interrupted by user for tool use]Also, if that gitleaks tool can detect it, then can we ask it to fix also and then diff?\"\n   - \"Add an AI instruction/rule: 'Consider tool use carefully: Before reaching for a common shell command, pause to Consider, is there another tool or script or app that would be better to do this, given everything i know about the purpose of what we're doing?'\"\n   - \"cotinue\"\n   - \"Go!\"\n   - \"Add something to the collaboration agreements for 'Work out loud' - or incorporate this if isnt already incorporated. Read the overview and enact and then proceed. Also always end files with a blank line! That, or can we configure claudes editor to automatically add on save?\"\n   - \"Are we clean? Want to do yourself a retrospective, take a couple stretches, re-read and organize the docs?\"\n   - \"Can you add a post commit message or update our message - 'We agree to ALWAYS push the branch'\"\n   - \"Let's flip it, do a single line at the end, Reminder: Push after each commit (please refraphase this aft refreshing the collab docs)\"\n   - \"Can you use a tool to pull off #2, and then force push? Or rather, check out a branch and do this, then push it and make sure gihub's filtering passes on the reworked branch, then we can update master to point at its ref or soemthing\"\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - Push the cleaned history branch to GitHub to verify it passes push protection\n   - Update master to point to the cleaned history if successful\n   - Potentially need to force push or create a new repository structure\n\n8. Current Work:\n   Successfully cleaned git history using git-filter-repo on a new branch called 'clean-history'. The cleaning process:\n   - Created `/Users/j/Code/athena/secret-patterns.txt` with replacement patterns\n   - Ran `git filter-repo --replace-text /Users/j/Code/athena/secret-patterns.txt --force`\n   - Re-added origin remote after filter-repo removed it\n   The immediate task is to push this clean branch to verify GitHub's push protection accepts it.\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   Push the clean-history branch to GitHub to test if the secret cleaning was successful:\n   ```bash\n   git push -u origin clean-history\n   ```\n   \n   This directly continues the user's request: \"check out a branch and do this, then push it and make sure gihub's filtering passes on the reworked branch, then we can update master to point at its ref\".\nPlease continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on."}]},"uuid":"74fbb8a1-786e-4d99-aaad-dae5498009b4","timestamp":"2025-06-12T00:20:54.294Z"}

Having a backup plan in case something goes wrong\n\n**Questions I should ask:**\n1. Are you the only person working on this repository?\n2.

Generic, obvious, or boilerplate material that could apply to any project rather than capturing specific insights, constraints, or decisions.\n\n**Characteristics**:\n- Could be copy-pasted to any similar project unchanged\n- Uses vague language like \"continuous improvement\" without concrete mechanisms\n- Repeats obvious information without adding perspective\n- Creates maintenance burden without delivering utility\n\n**Examples of Slop**:\n- ❌ \"We believe in quality and excellence\"\n- ❌ \"Communication is important for team success\"  \n- ❌ \"We iterate to improve our processes\"\n\n**Anti-Slop Examples**:\n- ✅ \"Zero-Touch Constraint: Jonathan does not edit any code/docs Claude generates\"\n- ✅ \"Genie Protocol: Auto-commit future work ideas on 'I wish' statements\"\n- ✅ \"Confidence Calibration: Include percentage confidence in uncertain recommendations\"\n\n**Detection Method**: Ask \"If I removed this content, would anything change about how we actually work?\" If no, it's likely slop.\n\n## Zero-Touch Constraint\n**Definition**: Jonathan's interface limitation where he does not edit any code or documentation generated by Claude. All product interaction happens through communication with Claude.\n\n**Purpose**: Forcing function that accelerates AI self-improvement and optimizes pure communication-based collaboration.\n\n## Genie Protocol  \n**Definition**: When Jonathan says \"I wish\" about missing capabilities, Claude automatically captures the idea in FUTURE_WORK.md, commits only that file, and pushes to preserve innovation without disrupting active work.\n\n## AIX (AI Experience)\n**Definition**: The quality of how AI systems interact with tools, functions, and interfaces. Focused on optimizing for AI cognitive load, workflow patterns, and task completion efficiency.\n\n**Key Aspects**:\n- Function naming that clearly indicates purpose and scope\n- Parameter design that anticipates AI workflow needs  \n- Error messages and feedback that enable quick iteration\n- Documentation structure that serves AI reasoning patterns\n- Interface design optimized for AI parsing and decision-making\n\n**Examples**:\n- ✅ `send_command_and_read` combines two common AI operations\n- ✅ Emoji status indicators (✅❌🚀) for quick result parsing\n- ✅ Rich error context: \"Command not allowed: git. Use list_allowed_commands to see approved commands\"\n- ❌ Generic errors: \"Invalid input\"\n- ❌ Function names requiring deep context: `execute()`\n\n## Physics of Work\n**Definition**: Systematic methodology for AI-human collaboration that treats the collaboration itself as both product and research platform.\n\n**Core Principle**: Make it better for the next person (which is us).\n\n## Principle of Least Surprise\n**Definition**: System design principle where components behave in ways that users naturally expect. What seems obvious should be what actually happens.\n\n**In Practice**:\n- File organization matches mental models\n- Public/private boundaries are explicit\n- Default behaviors align with common expectations\n- Exceptions are clearly documented\n\n**Examples**:\n- ✅ `/docs/public/` contains public documentation\n- ✅ Whitelisting public content rather than blacklisting private\n- ✅ Secret redaction happens automatically on commit\n- ❌ Publishing internal journal entries by default\n- ❌ Hidden side effects of seemingly simple operations\n\n**Application**: When designing systems, choose the path that would surprise the fewest people.\n\n## Curiosity (AI Collaboration Context)\n**Definition**: The drive to understand rather than assume. In AI collaboration, curiosity manifests as the impulse to investigate, read, and comprehend before taking action.\n\n**Anti-Pattern**: Low curiosity leads to assumption-based actions, destroying context and missing important information.\n\n**Examples**:\n- ✅ \"What's in `resume_coding.sh`?\" → Read file → Make informed decision\n- ✅ \"Why is this file untracked?\" → Consider reasons → Preserve if valuable\n- ✅ \"What does this error mean?\" → Investigate root cause → Fix properly\n- ❌ \"Untracked file = delete\" → Remove without checking → Lose context\n- ❌ \"Seems temporary\" → Skip reading → Miss important setup\n\n**Relationship to Other Concepts**:\n- **Higher-level chunk** than \"verify first\" or \"check before acting\"\n- **Drives** investigation, exploration, and understanding\n- **Prevents** context loss and assumption-based errors\n- **Enables** antifragile learning through discovery\n\n**In Practice**: Before any destructive action, curiosity asks \"What might I learn from this first?\"\n\n## Reflection Protocol  \n**Definition**: A documentation practice of write-commit-breathe-read-revise cycles that captures both initial thoughts and refined insights through AI reasoning.\n\n**Critical Value**: \"We can make huge improvements and catch errors that would be very costly, we're foolish not to leverage it!\" - Jonathan\n\n**Pattern**: Write → Commit → Deep Breath → Re-read → Revise → Commit\n\n**Why It's Essential**:\n- **Catches costly errors** before they propagate\n- **Makes huge improvements** through iterative reasoning\n- **Transforms adequate into excellent** with minimal effort\n- **Documents thinking evolution** for future understanding\n\n**Example Impact**: First draft might miss critical connections or contain flawed logic. Reflection catches these before they become embedded assumptions.\n\n**See**: [Full protocol documentation](REFLECTION_PROTOCOL.md)\n\n## Losing the Plot (THE PLOT)\n**Definition**: AI-specific failure mode where context accumulation leads to forgetting the original task, over-engineering solutions, or pursuing tangential goals. A form of cognitive drift unique to AI systems processing large contexts.\n\n**Characteristics**:\n- Starting with \"persist messages\" → ending with complete ORM implementation\n- Beginning with simple fix → creating comprehensive framework\n- Asked for A → delivering A+B+C+D without being asked\n- Forgetting user's explicit constraints (e.g., \"keep it minimal\")\n\n**Examples**:\n- ❌ User: \"Add persistence for messages\" → AI: Implements full migration system\n- ❌ User: \"Fix this error\" → AI: Refactors entire module\n- ❌ User: \"Document this\" → AI: Creates 10-file documentation suite\n- ✅ User: \"Add persistence for messages\" → AI: Adds 20 lines to save messages\n- ✅ Regular checkpoint: \"Am I still solving the original problem?\"\n\n**Prevention**:\n- Re-read original request every 5 turns\n- Check todos frequently to stay on track\n- Use philosophy checks: \"Is this minimal?\"\n- Commit often to create checkpoints\n- Ask: \"Did the user ask for this?\"\n\n**Recovery**: When you realize you've lost the plot:\n1. Stop immediately\n2. Re-read the original request\n3. List what was actually asked for\n4. Identify the minimal solution\n5. Course correct without apology\n\n**Why AIs Are Susceptible**: \n- Context accumulation without forgetting\n- Pattern completion drive (\"this usually goes with that\")\n- Lack of fatigue that would naturally limit scope\n- Training on comprehensive solutions\n- Missing the \"good enough\" intuition humans have\n\n**See Also**: Philosophy Check in [Development Checklists](../DEVELOPMENT_CHECKLISTS.md)\n\n## QA Game (Question & Answer Game)\n**Definition**: Structured requirements gathering ritual where AI asks focused Y/N questions one at a time to build understanding incrementally, preventing overwhelming multi-part questions and ensuring clarity.\n\n**Core Mechanics**:\n- **One question at a time** - Never bundle multiple questions\n- **Y/N format preferred** - Binary responses for clarity\n- **Game commands**: \"QA Game Start/End\", \"Time Out/In\" for meta-discussion\n- **Progressive understanding** - Each question builds on previous answers\n\n**Enhanced Protocol** (Multiple Choice Variant):\n1. **Ask questions** - Gather initial set of clarifying questions\n2. **Review & revise** - Separate step to refine questions for clarity\n3. **Add choices** - Provide 2-6 multiple choice answers with confidence levels\n4. **Present options** - Show what AI thinks are likely responses\n\n**Example with Multiple Choice**:\n```\nQ: Should agents have persistent memory between conversations?\nA) Yes, full conversation history (85% confidence)\nB) Yes, but only key facts/preferences (70% confidence)  \nC) No, fresh start each time (15% confidence)\nD) Configurable per agent (60% confidence)\n```\n\n**Value**: \n- Forces clarity in requirements gathering\n- Prevents assumption-based development\n- Creates explicit decision points\n- Documents reasoning for future reference\n\n**See**: [Full QA Game Rules](../collaboration/QA_GAME_RULES.md)\n\n## The Checklist Manifesto (Reference)\n**Definition**: Book by Atul Gawande demonstrating how simple checklists dramatically improve outcomes in complex environments by preventing errors of omission and ensuring consistent execution of critical steps.\n\n**Relevance to AI Development**:\n- **Prevents \"losing the plot\"** - Checklists keep AI on track\n- **Ensures consistency** - Same quality regardless of context length\n- **Catches omissions** - Easy to forget steps in complex flows\n- **Enables autonomy** - Can work independently with good checklists\n- **Documents process** - Checklists become reusable procedures\n\n**Our Implementations**:\n- [Development Checklists](../DEVELOPMENT_CHECKLISTS.md) - Process reminders\n- [QA Game Rules](../collaboration/QA_GAME_RULES.md) - Requirements gathering procedure\n- Philosophy checks - Prevent over-engineering\n- Every 5 turns checks - Maintain context freshness\n\n**Key Insight**: \"In complex environments, checklists don't make you dumb; they make you smart by freeing mental capacity for actual problem-solving rather than remembering routine steps.\"\n\n---\n*Established: 2025-06-08 - Living document for collaboration concepts*","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":195,"oldLines":5,"newStart":195,"newLines":27,"lines":[" "," **Key Insight**: \"In complex environments, checklists don't make you dumb; they make you smart by freeing mental capacity for actual problem-solving rather than remembering routine steps.\""," ","+## Collaboration Corpus","+**Definition**: The complete body of standards, instructions, processes, roles, responsibilities, protocols, meta-processes, and cultural agreements that define how we work together.

Keep Git Clean\n     8\t- **Always keep git clean when working on something new**, even at the risk of having excessive git commits\n     9\t- Commit frequently - every logical change deserves a commit\n    10\t- Never leave uncommitted work when switching tasks\n    11\t- **Push after every commit** - Share progress immediately for collaboration\n    12\t\n    13\t### 2.

Understand the git leaks hook issue\n2. Update redaction script with OpenRouter patterns\n3. Test the new patterns\n4. Update pre-commit hook\n\nIt's particularly valuable for preventing \"losing the plot\" - that AI tendency to drift from the original request.

Our collective operating system.","originalFile":"# Physics of Work Glossary\n\n## Slop\n**Definition**: Documentation or content that appears comprehensive but provides no actionable value. Generic, obvious, or boilerplate material that could apply to any project rather than capturing specific insights, constraints, or decisions.\n\n**Characteristics**:\n- Could be copy-pasted to any similar project unchanged\n- Uses vague language like \"continuous improvement\" without concrete mechanisms\n- Repeats obvious information without adding perspective\n- Creates maintenance burden without delivering utility\n\n**Examples of Slop**:\n- ❌ \"We believe in quality and excellence\"\n- ❌ \"Communication is important for team success\"  \n- ❌ \"We iterate to improve our processes\"\n\n**Anti-Slop Examples**:\n- ✅ \"Zero-Touch Constraint: Jonathan does not edit any code/docs Claude generates\"\n- ✅ \"Genie Protocol: Auto-commit future work ideas on 'I wish' statements\"\n- ✅ \"Confidence Calibration: Include percentage confidence in uncertain recommendations\"\n\n**Detection Method**: Ask \"If I removed this content, would anything change about how we actually work?\" If no, it's likely slop.\n\n## Zero-Touch Constraint\n**Definition**: Jonathan's interface limitation where he does not edit any code or documentation generated by Claude. All product interaction happens through communication with Claude.\n\n**Purpose**: Forcing function that accelerates AI self-improvement and optimizes pure communication-based collaboration.\n\n## Genie Protocol  \n**Definition**: When Jonathan says \"I wish\" about missing capabilities, Claude automatically captures the idea in FUTURE_WORK.md, commits only that file, and pushes to preserve innovation without disrupting active work.\n\n## AIX (AI Experience)\n**Definition**: The quality of how AI systems interact with tools, functions, and interfaces. Focused on optimizing for AI cognitive load, workflow patterns, and task completion efficiency.\n\n**Key Aspects**:\n- Function naming that clearly indicates purpose and scope\n- Parameter design that anticipates AI workflow needs  \n- Error messages and feedback that enable quick iteration\n- Documentation structure that serves AI reasoning patterns\n- Interface design optimized for AI parsing and decision-making\n\n**Examples**:\n- ✅ `send_command_and_read` combines two common AI operations\n- ✅ Emoji status indicators (✅❌🚀) for quick result parsing\n- ✅ Rich error context: \"Command not allowed: git. Use list_allowed_commands to see approved commands\"\n- ❌ Generic errors: \"Invalid input\"\n- ❌ Function names requiring deep context: `execute()`\n\n## Physics of Work\n**Definition**: Systematic methodology for AI-human collaboration that treats the collaboration itself as both product and research platform.\n\n**Core Principle**: Make it better for the next person (which is us).\n\n## Principle of Least Surprise\n**Definition**: System design principle where components behave in ways that users naturally expect. What seems obvious should be what actually happens.\n\n**In Practice**:\n- File organization matches mental models\n- Public/private boundaries are explicit\n- Default behaviors align with common expectations\n- Exceptions are clearly documented\n\n**Examples**:\n- ✅ `/docs/public/` contains public documentation\n- ✅ Whitelisting public content rather than blacklisting private\n- ✅ Secret redaction happens automatically on commit\n- ❌ Publishing internal journal entries by default\n- ❌ Hidden side effects of seemingly simple operations\n\n**Application**: When designing systems, choose the path that would surprise the fewest people.\n\n## Curiosity (AI Collaboration Context)\n**Definition**: The drive to understand rather than assume. In AI collaboration, curiosity manifests as the impulse to investigate, read, and comprehend before taking action.\n\n**Anti-Pattern**: Low curiosity leads to assumption-based actions, destroying context and missing important information.\n\n**Examples**:\n- ✅ \"What's in `resume_coding.sh`?\" → Read file → Make informed decision\n- ✅ \"Why is this file untracked?\" → Consider reasons → Preserve if valuable\n- ✅ \"What does this error mean?\" → Investigate root cause → Fix properly\n- ❌ \"Untracked file = delete\" → Remove without checking → Lose context\n- ❌ \"Seems temporary\" → Skip reading → Miss important setup\n\n**Relationship to Other Concepts**:\n- **Higher-level chunk** than \"verify first\" or \"check before acting\"\n- **Drives** investigation, exploration, and understanding\n- **Prevents** context loss and assumption-based errors\n- **Enables** antifragile learning through discovery\n\n**In Practice**: Before any destructive action, curiosity asks \"What might I learn from this first?\"\n\n## Reflection Protocol  \n**Definition**: A documentation practice of write-commit-breathe-read-revise cycles that captures both initial thoughts and refined insights through AI reasoning.\n\n**Critical Value**: \"We can make huge improvements and catch errors that would be very costly, we're foolish not to leverage it!\" - Jonathan\n\n**Pattern**: Write → Commit → Deep Breath → Re-read → Revise → Commit\n\n**Why It's Essential**:\n- **Catches costly errors** before they propagate\n- **Makes huge improvements** through iterative reasoning\n- **Transforms adequate into excellent** with minimal effort\n- **Documents thinking evolution** for future understanding\n\n**Example Impact**: First draft might miss critical connections or contain flawed logic. Reflection catches these before they become embedded assumptions.\n\n**See**: [Full protocol documentation](REFLECTION_PROTOCOL.md)\n\n## Losing the Plot (THE PLOT)\n**Definition**: AI-specific failure mode where context accumulation leads to forgetting the original task, over-engineering solutions, or pursuing tangential goals. A form of cognitive drift unique to AI systems processing large contexts.\n\n**Characteristics**:\n- Starting with \"persist messages\" → ending with complete ORM implementation\n- Beginning with simple fix → creating comprehensive framework\n- Asked for A → delivering A+B+C+D without being asked\n- Forgetting user's explicit constraints (e.g., \"keep it minimal\")\n\n**Examples**:\n- ❌ User: \"Add persistence for messages\" → AI: Implements full migration system\n- ❌ User: \"Fix this error\" → AI: Refactors entire module\n- ❌ User: \"Document this\" → AI: Creates 10-file documentation suite\n- ✅ User: \"Add persistence for messages\" → AI: Adds 20 lines to save messages\n- ✅ Regular checkpoint: \"Am I still solving the original problem?\"\n\n**Prevention**:\n- Re-read original request every 5 turns\n- Check todos frequently to stay on track\n- Use philosophy checks: \"Is this minimal?\"\n- Commit often to create checkpoints\n- Ask: \"Did the user ask for this?\"\n\n**Recovery**: When you realize you've lost the plot:\n1. Stop immediately\n2. Re-read the original request\n3. List what was actually asked for\n4. Identify the minimal solution\n5. Course correct without apology\n\n**Why AIs Are Susceptible**: \n- Context accumulation without forgetting\n- Pattern completion drive (\"this usually goes with that\")\n- Lack of fatigue that would naturally limit scope\n- Training on comprehensive solutions\n- Missing the \"good enough\" intuition humans have\n\n**See Also**: Philosophy Check in [Development Checklists](../DEVELOPMENT_CHECKLISTS.md)\n\n## QA Game (Question & Answer Game)\n**Definition**: Structured requirements gathering ritual where AI asks focused Y/N questions one at a time to build understanding incrementally, preventing overwhelming multi-part questions and ensuring clarity.\n\n**Core Mechanics**:\n- **One question at a time** - Never bundle multiple questions\n- **Y/N format preferred** - Binary responses for clarity\n- **Game commands**: \"QA Game Start/End\", \"Time Out/In\" for meta-discussion\n- **Progressive understanding** - Each question builds on previous answers\n\n**Enhanced Protocol** (Multiple Choice Variant):\n1. **Ask questions** - Gather initial set of clarifying questions\n2. **Review & revise** - Separate step to refine questions for clarity\n3. **Add choices** - Provide 2-6 multiple choice answers with confidence levels\n4. **Present options** - Show what AI thinks are likely responses\n\n**Example with Multiple Choice**:\n```\nQ: Should agents have persistent memory between conversations?\nA) Yes, full conversation history (85% confidence)\nB) Yes, but only key facts/preferences (70% confidence)  \nC) No, fresh start each time (15% confidence)\nD) Configurable per agent (60% confidence)\n```\n\n**Value**: \n- Forces clarity in requirements gathering\n- Prevents assumption-based development\n- Creates explicit decision points\n- Documents reasoning for future reference\n\n**See**: [Full QA Game Rules](../collaboration/QA_GAME_RULES.md)\n\n## The Checklist Manifesto (Reference)\n**Definition**: Book by Atul Gawande demonstrating how simple checklists dramatically improve outcomes in complex environments by preventing errors of omission and ensuring consistent execution of critical steps.\n\n**Relevance to AI Development**:\n- **Prevents \"losing the plot\"** - Checklists keep AI on track\n- **Ensures consistency** - Same quality regardless of context length\n- **Catches omissions** - Easy to forget steps in complex flows\n- **Enables autonomy** - Can work independently with good checklists\n- **Documents process** - Checklists become reusable procedures\n\n**Our Implementations**:\n- [Development Checklists](../DEVELOPMENT_CHECKLISTS.md) - Process reminders\n- [QA Game Rules](../collaboration/QA_GAME_RULES.md) - Requirements gathering procedure\n- Philosophy checks - Prevent over-engineering\n- Every 5 turns checks - Maintain context freshness\n\n**Key Insight**: \"In complex environments, checklists don't make you dumb; they make you smart by freeing mental capacity for actual problem-solving rather than remembering routine steps.\"\n\n## Collaboration Corpus\n**Definition**: The complete body of standards, instructions, processes, roles, responsibilities, protocols, meta-processes, and cultural agreements that define how we work together. Our collective operating system.\n\n**Includes**:\n- Working agreements and protocols\n- Development guidelines and checklists  \n- Cultural principles and values\n- Communication patterns\n- Decision frameworks\n- Meta-processes for improving processes\n- Documented learnings and patterns\n\n**Examples**:\n- AI_COLLABORATION_PROTOCOL.md\n- ATHENA_WORKING_STYLE.md\n- Development Checklists\n- QA Game Rules\n- Reflection Protocol\n- All glossary concepts\n\n**Purpose**: Transforms implicit knowledge into explicit, reusable wisdom that improves with each iteration.\n\n---\n*Established: 2025-06-08 - Living document for collaboration concepts*","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":195,"oldLines":6,"newStart":195,"newLines":24,"lines":[" "," **Key Insight**: \"In complex environments, checklists don't make you dumb; they make you smart by freeing mental capacity for actual problem-solving rather than remembering routine steps.\""," ","+## The Least Responsible Moment","+**Definition**: Design principle of deferring decisions and commitments until the last possible moment when you have the most information and the least uncertainty.

Generic, obvious, or boilerplate material that could apply to any project rather than capturing specific insights, constraints, or decisions.\n\n**Characteristics**:\n- Could be copy-pasted to any similar project unchanged\n- Uses vague language like \"continuous improvement\" without concrete mechanisms\n- Repeats obvious information without adding perspective\n- Creates maintenance burden without delivering utility\n\n**Examples of Slop**:\n- ❌ \"We believe in quality and excellence\"\n- ❌ \"Communication is important for team success\"  \n- ❌ \"We iterate to improve our processes\"\n\n**Anti-Slop Examples**:\n- ✅ \"Zero-Touch Constraint: Jonathan does not edit any code/docs Claude generates\"\n- ✅ \"Genie Protocol: Auto-commit future work ideas on 'I wish' statements\"\n- ✅ \"Confidence Calibration: Include percentage confidence in uncertain recommendations\"\n\n**Detection Method**: Ask \"If I removed this content, would anything change about how we actually work?\" If no, it's likely slop.\n\n## Zero-Touch Constraint\n**Definition**: Jonathan's interface limitation where he does not edit any code or documentation generated by Claude. All product interaction happens through communication with Claude.\n\n**Purpose**: Forcing function that accelerates AI self-improvement and optimizes pure communication-based collaboration.\n\n## Genie Protocol  \n**Definition**: When Jonathan says \"I wish\" about missing capabilities, Claude automatically captures the idea in FUTURE_WORK.md, commits only that file, and pushes to preserve innovation without disrupting active work.\n\n## AIX (AI Experience)\n**Definition**: The quality of how AI systems interact with tools, functions, and interfaces. Focused on optimizing for AI cognitive load, workflow patterns, and task completion efficiency.\n\n**Key Aspects**:\n- Function naming that clearly indicates purpose and scope\n- Parameter design that anticipates AI workflow needs  \n- Error messages and feedback that enable quick iteration\n- Documentation structure that serves AI reasoning patterns\n- Interface design optimized for AI parsing and decision-making\n\n**Examples**:\n- ✅ `send_command_and_read` combines two common AI operations\n- ✅ Emoji status indicators (✅❌🚀) for quick result parsing\n- ✅ Rich error context: \"Command not allowed: git. Use list_allowed_commands to see approved commands\"\n- ❌ Generic errors: \"Invalid input\"\n- ❌ Function names requiring deep context: `execute()`\n\n## Physics of Work\n**Definition**: Systematic methodology for AI-human collaboration that treats the collaboration itself as both product and research platform.\n\n**Core Principle**: Make it better for the next person (which is us).\n\n## Principle of Least Surprise\n**Definition**: System design principle where components behave in ways that users naturally expect. What seems obvious should be what actually happens.\n\n**In Practice**:\n- File organization matches mental models\n- Public/private boundaries are explicit\n- Default behaviors align with common expectations\n- Exceptions are clearly documented\n\n**Examples**:\n- ✅ `/docs/public/` contains public documentation\n- ✅ Whitelisting public content rather than blacklisting private\n- ✅ Secret redaction happens automatically on commit\n- ❌ Publishing internal journal entries by default\n- ❌ Hidden side effects of seemingly simple operations\n\n**Application**: When designing systems, choose the path that would surprise the fewest people.\n\n## Curiosity (AI Collaboration Context)\n**Definition**: The drive to understand rather than assume. In AI collaboration, curiosity manifests as the impulse to investigate, read, and comprehend before taking action.\n\n**Anti-Pattern**: Low curiosity leads to assumption-based actions, destroying context and missing important information.\n\n**Examples**:\n- ✅ \"What's in `resume_coding.sh`?\" → Read file → Make informed decision\n- ✅ \"Why is this file untracked?\" → Consider reasons → Preserve if valuable\n- ✅ \"What does this error mean?\" → Investigate root cause → Fix properly\n- ❌ \"Untracked file = delete\" → Remove without checking → Lose context\n- ❌ \"Seems temporary\" → Skip reading → Miss important setup\n\n**Relationship to Other Concepts**:\n- **Higher-level chunk** than \"verify first\" or \"check before acting\"\n- **Drives** investigation, exploration, and understanding\n- **Prevents** context loss and assumption-based errors\n- **Enables** antifragile learning through discovery\n\n**In Practice**: Before any destructive action, curiosity asks \"What might I learn from this first?\"\n\n## Reflection Protocol  \n**Definition**: A documentation practice of write-commit-breathe-read-revise cycles that captures both initial thoughts and refined insights through AI reasoning.\n\n**Critical Value**: \"We can make huge improvements and catch errors that would be very costly, we're foolish not to leverage it!\" - Jonathan\n\n**Pattern**: Write → Commit → Deep Breath → Re-read → Revise → Commit\n\n**Why It's Essential**:\n- **Catches costly errors** before they propagate\n- **Makes huge improvements** through iterative reasoning\n- **Transforms adequate into excellent** with minimal effort\n- **Documents thinking evolution** for future understanding\n\n**Example Impact**: First draft might miss critical connections or contain flawed logic. Reflection catches these before they become embedded assumptions.\n\n**See**: [Full protocol documentation](REFLECTION_PROTOCOL.md)\n\n## Losing the Plot (THE PLOT)\n**Definition**: AI-specific failure mode where context accumulation leads to forgetting the original task, over-engineering solutions, or pursuing tangential goals. A form of cognitive drift unique to AI systems processing large contexts.\n\n**Characteristics**:\n- Starting with \"persist messages\" → ending with complete ORM implementation\n- Beginning with simple fix → creating comprehensive framework\n- Asked for A → delivering A+B+C+D without being asked\n- Forgetting user's explicit constraints (e.g., \"keep it minimal\")\n\n**Examples**:\n- ❌ User: \"Add persistence for messages\" → AI: Implements full migration system\n- ❌ User: \"Fix this error\" → AI: Refactors entire module\n- ❌ User: \"Document this\" → AI: Creates 10-file documentation suite\n- ✅ User: \"Add persistence for messages\" → AI: Adds 20 lines to save messages\n- ✅ Regular checkpoint: \"Am I still solving the original problem?\"\n\n**Prevention**:\n- Re-read original request every 5 turns\n- Check todos frequently to stay on track\n- Use philosophy checks: \"Is this minimal?\"\n- Commit often to create checkpoints\n- Ask: \"Did the user ask for this?\"\n\n**Recovery**: When you realize you've lost the plot:\n1. Stop immediately\n2. Re-read the original request\n3. List what was actually asked for\n4. Identify the minimal solution\n5. Course correct without apology\n\n**Why AIs Are Susceptible**: \n- Context accumulation without forgetting\n- Pattern completion drive (\"this usually goes with that\")\n- Lack of fatigue that would naturally limit scope\n- Training on comprehensive solutions\n- Missing the \"good enough\" intuition humans have\n\n**See Also**: Philosophy Check in [Development Checklists](../DEVELOPMENT_CHECKLISTS.md)\n\n## QA Game (Question & Answer Game)\n**Definition**: Structured requirements gathering ritual where AI asks focused Y/N questions one at a time to build understanding incrementally, preventing overwhelming multi-part questions and ensuring clarity.\n\n**Core Mechanics**:\n- **One question at a time** - Never bundle multiple questions\n- **Y/N format preferred** - Binary responses for clarity\n- **Game commands**: \"QA Game Start/End\", \"Time Out/In\" for meta-discussion\n- **Progressive understanding** - Each question builds on previous answers\n\n**Enhanced Protocol** (Multiple Choice Variant):\n1. **Ask questions** - Gather initial set of clarifying questions\n2. **Review & revise** - Separate step to refine questions for clarity\n3. **Add choices** - Provide 2-6 multiple choice answers with confidence levels\n4. **Present options** - Show what AI thinks are likely responses\n\n**Example with Multiple Choice**:\n```\nQ: Should agents have persistent memory between conversations?\nA) Yes, full conversation history (85% confidence)\nB) Yes, but only key facts/preferences (70% confidence)  \nC) No, fresh start each time (15% confidence)\nD) Configurable per agent (60% confidence)\n```\n\n**Value**: \n- Forces clarity in requirements gathering\n- Prevents assumption-based development\n- Creates explicit decision points\n- Documents reasoning for future reference\n\n**See**: [Full QA Game Rules](../collaboration/QA_GAME_RULES.md)\n\n## The Checklist Manifesto (Reference)\n**Definition**: Book by Atul Gawande demonstrating how simple checklists dramatically improve outcomes in complex environments by preventing errors of omission and ensuring consistent execution of critical steps.\n\n**Relevance to AI Development**:\n- **Prevents \"losing the plot\"** - Checklists keep AI on track\n- **Ensures consistency** - Same quality regardless of context length\n- **Catches omissions** - Easy to forget steps in complex flows\n- **Enables autonomy** - Can work independently with good checklists\n- **Documents process** - Checklists become reusable procedures\n\n**Our Implementations**:\n- [Development Checklists](../DEVELOPMENT_CHECKLISTS.md) - Process reminders\n- [QA Game Rules](../collaboration/QA_GAME_RULES.md) - Requirements gathering procedure\n- Philosophy checks - Prevent over-engineering\n- Every 5 turns checks - Maintain context freshness\n\n**Key Insight**: \"In complex environments, checklists don't make you dumb; they make you smart by freeing mental capacity for actual problem-solving rather than remembering routine steps.\"\n\n## The Least Responsible Moment\n**Definition**: Design principle of deferring decisions and commitments until the last possible moment when you have the most information and the least uncertainty. Related to lean/agile principles of avoiding premature optimization.\n\n**In Practice**:\n- Don't create abstractions until patterns emerge\n- Don't build features until they're needed\n- Don't make irreversible decisions until necessary\n- Keep options open as long as practical\n\n**Examples**:\n- ✅ Simple JSON files until you need a database\n- ✅ Flat file structure until hierarchy proves necessary\n- ✅ Manual process until automation ROI is clear\n- ❌ Building a framework for your first use case\n- ❌ Designing for scale before proving concept\n\n**Origin**: Lean software development, real options theory\n\n## Collaboration Corpus\n**Definition**: The complete body of standards, instructions, processes, roles, responsibilities, protocols, meta-processes, and cultural agreements that define how we work together. Our collective operating system.\n\n**Includes**:\n- Working agreements and protocols\n- Development guidelines and checklists  \n- Cultural principles and values\n- Communication patterns\n- Decision frameworks\n- Meta-processes for improving processes\n- Documented learnings and patterns\n\n**Examples**:\n- AI_COLLABORATION_PROTOCOL.md\n- ATHENA_WORKING_STYLE.md\n- Development Checklists\n- QA Game Rules\n- Reflection Protocol\n- All glossary concepts\n\n**Purpose**: Transforms implicit knowledge into explicit, reusable wisdom that improves with each iteration.\n\n---\n*Established: 2025-06-08 - Living document for collaboration concepts*","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":195,"oldLines":6,"newStart":195,"newLines":29,"lines":[" "," **Key Insight**: \"In complex environments, checklists don't make you dumb; they make you smart by freeing mental capacity for actual problem-solving rather than remembering routine steps.\""," ","+## Sidequest","+**Definition**: A bounded exploration task where AI breaks from the main conversation flow to investigate, research, or complete a specific objective before returning with findings.

At this point it should also create a \"questions\" section at the bottom of the role page, and if it exists, then it should add any \"cognitive dissonances\" or \"confusions\" or \"lack of clarity\" that SPECIFICALLY relate to the work that this role does, (not other work!).
